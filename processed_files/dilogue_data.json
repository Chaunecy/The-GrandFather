        " Well, I can see that you\u2019re busy\u2026 Merry Christmas, Rick.\n",
        " *stands and hugs her* It\u2019s alright! The TV says there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\n",
        " Sure, sweetie. *pulls out the stocking and gives Summer her phone, then gives Beth her tablet* Everybody, take a device. It\u2019ll help you relax.\n",
        " Yeah. *puts an arm around Beth and Jacob* I guess we really learned something this Christmas, Jacob.\n",
        " Well, um, traditionally science fairs are a father-son thing.\n",
        " Yes! You backed the right horse on this one, son! We\u2019ll get out the crayons, brew some coffee and knock this thing out in two or three days.\n",
        " Maybe Rick can give you a ride. I\u2019m helping Morty with science.\n",
        " Why don\u2019t we do a model of the solar system? That\u2019s what my dad did with me when I was your age.\n",
        " You know, Rick\u2019s in his lab making cyborgs and wormholes and all that weird stuff, but this is real science! A man and his boy, making planets! Hey, how \u2018bout we use a ping-pong ball for Pluto, and then Jupiter-\n",
        "  Of course Pluto\u2019s a planet, son, I learned that in the third grade.\n",
        " Morty, nobody changed the planets.\n",
        " Yeah, I heard about that, Morty. And I disagree.\n",
        " That\u2019s right. It\u2019s possible to disagree in science, Morty. Pluto was a planet, some committee of fancy assholes disagree, I disagreed back. Gimmie a ping-pong ball.\n",
        " Go find Rick and go for my head about Pluto?\n",
        " Oh.  Okay good. This is gonna be fun!\n",
        " What are you guys talking about?\n",
        " You asked him if Pluto\u2019s a planet, didn\u2019t you?\n",
        " Shut up, Rick.\n",
        " I don\u2019t care what anyone says. If it can be a planet, it can be a planet again. Planet. Planet planet planet.\n",
        " I told you, I want to file a declaration that Pluto is a planet! \u2026 Well, then my son\u2019s going to fail his science class, and when that happens, I\u2019m suing you first!  I think I know what the A in NASA stands for.\n",
        " Ain\u2019t no game, sucka.\n",
        " Sure, sure, and why don\u2019t we just burn Galileo at the stake for saying the sun is round? Science isn\u2019t always easy, Morty!\n",
        " What the hell?\n",
        " I was\u2026 you know\u2026 sometimes science is about conviction.\n",
        " Oh. I\u2026\n",
        " Pluto\u2026 is a planet.\n",
        " Pluto is a planet.\n",
        " Alright, just one more rally, then I promise, we\u2019ll get back to your science project.\n",
        " Yeah, that\u2019s what that anti-planet nutjob Scroopy Noopers was screaming about outside the Ministry of Moneys fundraiser. Are you telling me four billion plutonians are wrong?\n",
        " I said science isn\u2019t always easy, obviously that means sometimes it is easy. Let\u2019s not debase ourselves with word games, son.\n",
        " Hah! You called it a planet! Checkmate.\n",
        " What\u2019s up, Pluto?\n",
        " My Very Eager Mother Just Served Us Nine Pickles, and the pickles is Pluto.\n",
        " Morty, what?\n",
        " ...Well son, what did you think when you were five, and you pooped your pants, and you threw your poopy undies out your bedroom window because you thought it was like throwing something in the garbage?\n",
        " I mean, I\u2019m trimming the hedges and these things are just hanging there, was I supposed to think the poop bunny left them?\n",
        " I\u2019m flattered, and humbled.\n",
        " What?\n",
        " Did he call you father? Scroopy Noopers, the anti-planet nutjob is your son?\n",
        " It\u2019s a what?\n",
        " Pluto is\u2026\n",
        "  Not a planet.\n",
        " Ow! It\u2019s not a planet! Hey! It\u2019s not a planet! I\u2019m an idiot, and I love my son!\n",
        " Hey!\n",
        " Hey Morty.\n",
        " Ah, some people just can\u2019t handle the truth. Especially dummies like me. Morty, I\u2019m not as smart as your grandpa Rick, but I promise never to make that your problem again.\n",
        " Wow\u2026 that\u2019s humbling\u2026 and flattering, son. Thank you. What say we finish ourselves an 8-planet solar system?\n",
        " But-\n",
        " Oh. I uh- I think I underst-\n",
        " I get it! Say no more.\n",
        " I got it! Noted! Goodnight!\n",
        " Eh, Try not to worry about it, Morty. You're a good kid, and there's not a premium on that right now, but you'll be getting girls sometime after Brad's out of shape.\n",
        " Ahhh, well,  I remember feeling that way about a young lady named your mom, and that's not an urban dis, your mom was my Jessica. I remember the first time I saw her, I thought...\n",
        " I beg your pardon, Rick, INAPPROPRIATE. \n",
        "  My marriage is fine, thank you.\n",
        " Yeah, I'm just going to...check on your mom. \n",
        " Beth, do you still love me?\n",
        " The \"yes\" or \"no\" kind. *weak laugh of obviousness*\n",
        " Yess.\n",
        " Noo.\n",

        " Yeah, right,\n",

        " Okay, Jerry, big pitch meeting. Make-or-break time. *trims nostril hairs while driving* You can do this.\n",
        " *inhales deeply* Gotta relax. It's just a pitch. Gotta relax.\n",
        " Hmm. Human music. I like it. *rocks head side to side in rhythm with the music*\n",

        " Welcome to our ad agency. I'm Jerry Smith.  Alright. I'll just get to the pitch. Um, simple question, gentlemen, *hoarsely* what are apples? *clears throat* Excuse me. *drinks some water* Ahh. *coughs, clears throat* What are apples? *pulls poster board to the front of the room* Apples are food. And when do we need food? When we're hungry.  With that, I give you your new slogan!  Well, say something! Do you like it?\n",
        " You do?\n",
        " So I sold it? I sold the idea?\n",
        " Oh my god! Thank you!\n",
        " Hey! I just sold my first pitch!\n",
        " Guess who just sold the apples campaign.\n",
        " Me! I guess it wasn't a rip-off of \"got milk?\" after all. Guess someone was wrong.\n",
        " Well, all is forgiven, because right now, I\u2019ve got an erection the size of an East Coast lighthouse, and I\u2019m coming home to share it with my beautiful wife.\n",
        " Wait, really?\n",
        " Yes! See you in 10 minutes! *hangs up, shouts* Hey! I'm going to make love to my wife!\n",

        " Yeah! You like that? Now who's unremarkable? You hungry for apples? Are you hungry for apples?!\n",
        " Oh, my god. That's the best sex I've ever had in my life. It's\u2026 it's too good. I don't deserve this, Beth. I'm a fraud.\n",
        " Mr. Marklevitz, do you have a minute to talk?\n",
        " Look, I\u2019m a fraud. I mean, let's face it. \"Hungry for apples\" is just a rip-off of \"Got milk?\" It's almost identical.\n",
        " Okay. I deserve that. Um, I guess I'll just pack up my desk.\n",
        " *crying* Oh my god. Wait. You know what?! No! The milk people don't have a patent on simple rhetorical questions! Y-You\u2014 There's not even a single word in \"Hungry for Apples\" that's shared by \"Got milk?\" It's a completely different slogan. It's different! And I shouldn't be fired. I should be promoted!\n",
        " Yeah! Wait. Really?\n",
        " Yes! I mean, it may be derivative, but it's the most successful campaign to come out of this agency in a long time.\n",
        " I-I\u2019m not saying it should win an award for commercials, but it could certainly be nominated for an award for commercials specifically about apples, like an Appley or something.\n",
        " Is there really an award called the Appley for apple-related ad campaigns?\n",
        " Could we nominate me?\n",
        " Holy crap!\n",
        " I got to tell you, this morning, I didn't even know this award existed. Now I'm holding one. And, um\u2026 Look, I want to say that today was the best day of my life But the truth is, it's, it's more meaningful than that.\n",

        " *sobbing* No!\n",

        " So\u2026 What do you think?\n",

        " Well, yeah, on horses.\n",

        " Oh, for crying out\u2014he's got some kind of disability or something. Is that what you want us to say?\n",
        " Well, duh doy, son. Look, I love you, Morty, but we both know you're not as fast as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard.\n",
        "  Holy crap. He's right.\n",
        " But\u2014\n",
        " No, I-I understand. Uh, maybe we overreacted. But he has to keep going to school.\n",
        " Okay. Well, uh, Morty, it's your bedtime in an hour. Don't stay up all night again. This is good, though. This can work. I think we can be a family and now, Beth, if you'll have me, I would love to have you.\n",
        " Hey, Rick, you got some kind of hand-shaped device that can open this mayonnaise jar?\n",
        "  Wow!\n",
        " If we're gonna use this thing, which I'm not even sure we should, we need to keep it simple.\n",

        " Don't tell me that! That just puts pressure on me!\n",
        " You try to relax! Have you ever tried to relax?! It is a paradox!  Ugh, these Meeseeks, huh? Kind of a handful. I can't imagine what you two must be going through.\n",

        " Dad, what\u2019s your endgame?\n",
        " Why don\u2019t we just make the solar system with eight planets? It\u2019s even easier!\n",
        "  Oh man, this is definitely gonna go to his head.\n",
        " Uh\u2026 I\u2019d better not.\n",
        " Um\u2026 A party?\n",
        " For sure me and my dad are.\n",
        " Uh, yeah, you know, the thing is\u2026 my dad\u2019s really insecure.\n",
        " Dad, Pluto isn\u2019t a planet! It\u2019s shrinking because of corporations!\n",
        " You told me science wasn\u2019t easy!\n",
        " Dad, their whole planet is dying!\n",
        " Um, excuse me? \n",
        " Dad, what did you think about the recent report published by the Pluto Science Reader, linking plutoquakes, sinkholes and surface shrinkage to deep core plutonium drilling?\n",
        " Good one, dad.\n",
        " Um\u2026 listen, can you help me do this stupid science fair project?\n",
        " Oh! Hey dad!  Um\u2026 What are you doing back from Pluto so quick?\n",
        " Hey, dad? Nobody\u2019s smarter than Rick. But nobody else is my dad. You\u2019re a genius at that.\n",
        " Um\u2026 I\u2019m just going to take this thing in and\u2026 get an A. \n",
        " You\u2019re a genius at being my dad, dad. Quit while you\u2019re ahead. And also, knock next time, you know? I mean, I\u2019m sitting in here, I\u2019m 14! I got a computer in here, you know!\n",
        " You know you\u2019re really playing with fire when you burst in here like that, man.\n",
        " I mean, one of these days, you know, you\u2019re gonna, you\u2019re gonna end up seeing something-\n",
        " Ohhh. Okay, here we go. * walks over to Jessica and her friends*  H-Heyy Jessica, ughh.\n",
        " Ugghh\n",
        " Ummm\n",
        " Well, I mean, I was thinking about it.\n",
        "  You're missing the point, Dad. I don't want girls, I want Jessica!\n",
        " Come on, Rick, don't talk about my parents like that.\n",
        "  Alright, well, I'm gonna go get dressed for the dance. \n",
        " Hey, listen, Rick. You know how you said that, you know... love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier?  Well, I was thinkn', you know, www... could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of Jessica's mind, you know, so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing, you know, like maybe make some sort of love potion or something?\n",
        "  YOU KNOW WHAT, NO RICK! I'M NOT GONNA HAND YOU THE SCREWDRIVER! Uh, I'm never gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick.  I'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing. Www...what about me, Rick? Www... why can't you just help me out once, once, for once?\n",
        " Oh well, okay... \n",
        " Oww!\n",
        " Heck yeah! Thank you, Grandpa Rick!  Hey there's no dangers or anything or side effects, right?\n",
        " Hey there, Jessica.  Whooa-whoopsie!\n",
        " WOW, thanks!\n",
        " Oh man. I love you too, Jessica! \n",
        " Oh, well, no problem Brad.\n",
        "  Whoa, take it easy!\n",
        "  Uh, sure. I mean, of course not. What do you think that was all about?\n",
        " Hey, uh, Rick, um, you think maybe I could get something from this place, like a souvenir, like, just to have ---like, something cool, you know?\n",
        " Oh, okay,\n",
        " Yeah! You know, I mean, it's different from the stuff on earth, and, you know, you take me to all these crazy places across the galaxy, and, you know,\n",
        " Whew!\n",
        " Um, Rick, could you come with me, please -- q-quickly?\n",
        " That is Gwendolyn --\n",
        " I lost the chance to be careful, Rick,\n",
        " Ohh,\n",
        "\n",
        " Knock it off, both of you!\n",
        " Oh, Morty Jr,! you're gonna be a special little guy, aren't you?\n",
        " \"Dada,\"\n",
        " Um,,,\"Dada\"?\n",
        " Oh, man!\n",
        " No, Morty Jr,\n",
        " Ohh!\n",
        " No! Absolutely not!\n",
        " Yeah, but you can't go out there because the -- the air is poisonous for you!\n",
        "\n",
        " Because I said so!\n",
        " Morty Jr,! Smoking?!\n",
        " So what?!\n",
        " Oh, here we go again!\n",
        " All right, that's it -- no more history channel!\n",
        " You take that back!\n",
        " No! No, no, no! Stop!\n",
        " My son is gonna take over the planet, and I am too young to drive!\n",
        " Oh, my god!\n",
        " Dad, there he is!\n",
        " Oh, my god!\n",
        " Morty Jr,, no!\n",
        " He's my son!\n",
        " I know, Morty Jr,\n",
        " We all have bad impulses, bad thoughts,\n",
        " Well, you know,\n",
        " Aw, see?\n",
        " I know you can do it, son,\n",
        " Aaaaaaah!\n",
        " I hope he's eating enough.\n",
        " Hey, Rick. Boy, sure is really especially beautiful out there today, huh?\n",
        " Yeah, you know? There's something about the air. And just the way the sunshine is.\n",
        " Wh\u2026 convincing?\n",
        " Uhhokay.\n",
        " What's with Mom?\n",
        " Okay, you know what, Rick? You're acting weird, too.\n",
        " Alright, well I'll see you after school.  Ow! Oof! Ugh! Damn it! I'm all right. I'm okay.\n",
        " Uh, me?\n",
        " Um, you know, it's, uh, at least 40.\n",
        " W-w-w-what do you want me to teach you?\n",
        " Concentrated huh?\n",
        " Uhhh\u2026\n",
        " Oh, yeah, but, you know, he told me that I shouldn't go around spouting off about, you know, his science and stuff.\n",
        " Uh, y-you will?\n",
        " Aw, man!  Rick, I have to go back! I think I was about to get married! *falls down* Ugh!\n",
        " What?!\n",
        " Ugh! I'm gonna get an F in class, Rick. *strips*\n",
        " Wait a minute. W-what are you talking about?\n",
        " Monitor us?! *looks around and tries to cover himself* W-who?!\n",
        " Aw, come on, Rick. If everyone\u2019s just gonna be insane today, at least let me be insane with Jessica.\n",
        " Give it to me!\n",
        " G-g-give it!\n",
        " No, Rick!\n",
        " Rick!\n",
        " I don't know, Rick. I mean, I\u2019ve seen people do that before.\n",
        " Uh, Mrs. Spencer does that all the time, Rick.\n",
        " Okay, okay, you got me on that one.\n",
        " No, no. I haven't seen that. I mean, why would a Poptart wanna live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be, like, the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean?\n",
        " So, why are they doing this? W-what do they want? \n",
        " Concentrated dark matter! They were asking about that in class.\n",
        " Wait, wha, w-w-what are we gonna do?\n",
        " Aw, geez, Rick. I-I don't know if I like this plan,you know? I mean, crowds, t-t-t-they have a tendency to make me really nervous.\n",
        " You got that right, Rick.\n",
        " Oh, man, Rick! W-w-w-where we running to?\n",
        " Holy crap!\n",
        " *jumps off edge*\n",
        " So, hey, why do these aliens keep coming after you, Rick, if you're so much smarter than them?\n",
        " I\u2019ve got so many, I can barely hold them all! *holding chips in his shirt* Look at, look at this. Oops. I dropped one.\n",
        " Come on, quit it, Rick! Quit it!\n",
        " Wow. What do you know? Huh. That was easy.\n",
        " Just kind of hard to believe, you know?\n",
        " Oh my god!\n",
        " Dad!\n",
        " Oh, man! They're hot on our tail, Rick!\n",
        " Well, you know how to make it, too, right, Rick?\n",
        " Whoa! It's all here, Rick!\n",
        " Okay. Uh-huh. Alright.\n",
        " *freezes up*\n",
        " What?\n",
        " Aw, geez, Rick. What are you doing, man?\n",
        " Oh, boy.\n",
        " Have you been drinking, Rick?\n",
        " O-okay, cool. A-alright, Rick\n",
        " No! No! No!\n",
        " *terrified, gasps*\n",
        " Geez!\n",
        " Oh my god!\n",
        " W-w-what the hell? What a life.",
        "  What, Rick? What\u2019s going on?\n",
        " It's the middle of the night. What are you talking about?\n",
        " Ow! Ow! You're tugging me too hard!\n",
        " Yeah, Rick... I-it's great. Is this the surprise?\n",
        " What?! A bomb?!\n",
        " T-t-that's absolutely crazy!\n",
        " Jessica? From my math class?\n",
        " Ohh...\n",
        " Whhhh-wha?\n",
        " No, you can't!  Jessica doesn't even know I exist! But\u2014but, but forget about that, because you can't blow up humanity!\n",
        " What are you talking about, Rick?\n",
        " I don't care about Jessica! Y-Yyyyyyyyyyou\u2014\n",
        "  That's it... that's it, Rick. I'm taking the wheel. \n",
        " I'm taking charge of this situation, buddy!  I'm put\u2014I\u2019m, I'm, I'm, I'm puttin\u2019... I-I\u2019m, I\u2019m, I\u2019m not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb... dumb person and just le-let you ruin the whole world!\n",
        " Oh, thank god.\n",
        " It was?\n",
        " Um...\n",
        " I wasn't kissing a pillow, mom. I just I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something.\n",
        " Jessica.\n",
        " Jessica. \n",
        " Whoa! Hi, Jessica.\n",
        " Wow. Th-they're both great. Thank you!\n",
        "  Uh, that's flattering... and a little weird.\n",
        " Rename them?\n",
        " Wow. Well, okay, Jessica. L-let's give this a shot. \n",
        " Uh, I-I'm just doing my best. \n",
        "  Ah, Jessica.\n",
        " Jessica.\n",
        " Je-Jessica. Jessica.\n",
        " Uh, morning, Frank.\n",
        " Oh, geez, Frank. I don't know if a knife is necessary. I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it.\n",
        " Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-what'd you do to Frank?\n",
        " I don't know, Rick. I can't leave school again.\n",
        " Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip history. What about Frank? I mean, shouldn't you unfreeze him?\n",
        " Oh, geez, okay. \n",
        " Oh, man, Rick. What is this place?\n",
        " Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking around this place, and I'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing.\n",
        " All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn't I be back at school by now?\n",
        " Yeah, Rick, I get it. We're surrounded by monsters. That's kind of the reason why I want to leave. \n",
        " The mega trees?\n",
        " All right, all right. So, what's so special about these seeds, anyways?\n",
        "  AAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!\n",
        " I'm in a lot of pain, Rick!\n",
        " Are you kidding me?! That's it, Rick! That's the last straw! I can't believe this! I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken, and you're still asking me about getting those seeds?! Ooh! Ow! Oh! Y-y-you're a monster. Y-you're like Hitler, but-but even Hitler cared about Germany or something.\n",
        " Ooh! Ohh! Ooh! Hnngh! Hoo! Ooh! Ohh! Aaaaagh! Oooooh! \n",
        " Ooh, Ohh, Ooh. Wow, Rick. That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly. I mean, I've never felt so good in my life. Thank you.\n",
        " Sure thing, Rick. \n",
        " Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick.\n",
        " What?!\n",
        " Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good. W-what are we gonna do? I-I have to be back at school right now. How are we gonna get back home?\n",
        " Uh-oh.\n",
        " In my butt?\n",
        " Oh, geez, Rick. I really don't want to have to do that.\n",
        " Uuuh.\n",
        " In my butt?\n",
        " Oh, man.\n",
        " Yeah, Rick. Let's just get this over with, okay? I mean, these things are pointy. They hurt.\n",
        " Aaaaaah!\n",
        " Ohhhhh! \n",
        " Ohhhhhh! \n",
        " Aaaaah!\n",
        " Whoooooo! \n",
        " Oh, man. I mean, you know, I-I don't want to shoot nobody.\n",
        " They're not robots, Rick!\n",
        " Holy crap! This is insane! \n",
        " Uh, yeah. Well, you know, my-my Ferrari's in the shop.  Just kidding.\n",
        " Yeah. \n",
        " Dad, mom, come on. Rick just needed my help is all.\n",
        " I do?\n",
        " Aw, geez, dad. Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once.\n",
        " Oh, come on, Rick. You know I can't.\n",
        " 1.77245385... Whoa!\n",
        " \"The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system.\" Wow! I'm so smart!\n",
        " Holy cow, Rick. I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter.\n",
        " Aw, man.\n",
        " Ohh, man.  Oh, geez! Ohh. \n",
        " I can\u2019t do it, Rick! They\u2019re my parents and sister!\n",
        " Ohhhh\u2026\n",
        " I just killed my family! I don\u2019t care what they were!\n",
        " Y-You know what, Rick? That\u2019s it! I-I\u2019m done with these\u2026insane adventures! That was really traumatizing! I quit! I\u2019m out!\n",
        " *pushes Rick\u2019s hands away* You\u2019re the one that\u2019s crazy and chaotic! Adventures are supposed to be simple! And fun!\n",
        " *suddenly excited* Seriously Rick?! Y-You\u2019ll let me call the shots?\n",
        " Okay, all right, tough guy! But if my adventure's good... I get to be in charge of every third adventure!\n",
        " Deal. All right. Well, come on, let's get going.\n",
        " Oh, that sounds like something a chicken would say. Bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk.\n",
        " All right! Get out of here now! Everybody out of here! I got a bet to win!\n",
        " Rick, this is a fantasy-type world with creatures and all sorts of fantasy things. We're going on a quest, okay?\n",
        " Ahem. Excuse me! We are two humble heroes in search of adventure!\n",
        " You know what? I accept your call to adventure, good sir, kind sir. Come on, Rick. There's a giant in the clouds!\n",
        " Would you just relax, Rick? All we got to do is find the treasure room, okay? It's nice and simple. You know, I'm sorry everything's going so smoothly and adventurously.\n",
        " Come on, hurry. Behind this cookie jar.\n",
        " No way, Rick. This is all part of it. Adventures have conflict. Deal with it.\n",
        " Holy crap.\n",
        " Th-th but that's not how it went down!\n",
        " We're gonna be okay, Rick.\n",
        " Oh, man, what did I tell you, Rick? We did it!\n",
        " Oh, yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Rick? Well, you know what? We're not bailing out just yet. You know, we're gonna go find some treasure or something and and we're gonna bring it to those villagers.\n",
        " Yeah, you were saying that back when we first got arrested, but here we are, you know, walking down the courthouse steps.\n",
        " Usually, walking down the courthouse steps is the easy part of the adventure.\n",
        " I say give me a hand, sidekick.\n",
        " All right, okay, you know, if this was a story, this part wouldn't be included, stupid.  Hey, Rick, what do you know? Look down there. Looks like some kind of tavern or something built right into the side of the step.\n",
        " Oh, wow, Rick. Now, this is more like it. Look, there's little staircase-shaped people in here. All kinds of crazy characters. This place is great, you know? It's whimsical and fun.\n",
        " Easy, Rick.\n",
        " Rick... We'll have two bloogies, please. And, uh, we were wondering, is there a faster way two heroes could get down these stairs?\n",
        " You keep heckling my adventure, Rick! You know why?\n",
        " It's because you're petty! You know, how many times have I had to follow you into some nonsensical bull crap? I always roll with the punches, Rick. Why can't you? Look, I got to take a leak, and when I come back, if you haven't learned how to lighten up, don't be here!\n",
        " Hi, Mr. Jelly Bean. I'm Morty. My grandpa and I are on an adventure.\n",
        " I hope so. But I'm starting to get nervous that maybe it's gone a little too far off the rails.\n",
        " Hey, you know what? You're right. Everything's going fine. I just got to relax and go with the flow.\n",
        " Okay. Uh. B-bye.\n",
        " Stop. You're making me really uncomfortable.\n",
        " Get off of me!\n",
        " Whoo! No! Stop! Please!\n",
        " No! No!\n",
        " Look, I want to leave now. You win the bet, okay? Just give me the portal gun and let's go, please. Please, I just want to go home.\n",
        " Really?\n",
        " Thanks, Rick, but I don't know if I should. You know, you were right about the universe. It's a crazy and chaotic place.\n",
        " Uh, no, I-it's cool. Rick. Portal. Hurry.\n",
        " Summer, next time we're hiding in a Colorkian echo nest, can you do me a favor and turn your ringer off?\n",
        " You look it up! Y-Y-You don't even-You don't even know what it means!\n",
        " W-We'll see you every other weekend, though, right?\n",
        " Th-That'll be nice. Uh, Summer, Dad's leaving!\n",
        " Well, I-I better--\n",
        " They all have mohawks!\n",
        " Uh-huh, yeah, is it powerful enough to keep those guys from murdering us?!\n",
        " Summer!\n",
        " Rick, can we not leave without my sister?!\n",
        "Summer!\n",
        " Jesus Christ. Summer! \n",
        " What is your deal lately? \n",
        " What?!\n",
        " Listen, Rick, Summer's been acting pretty crazy lately. You know, I mean, I-I think the divorce is affecting her. And, you know, I don't think this is a great place for her to be right now.\n",
        "  Seriously, Rick? Is it really easier to eat human flesh than to just tell me why we're still here? \n",
        " Isotope 322.\n",
        " Summer just ran off with strangers that have \"Death\" in their name, and the rest of their name was \"Stalkers\"!\n",
        " Damn it, Rick, that's what I-- Fine. Just grab the stupid thing while I grab her, and let's get the \"F\" out of \"H\"!\n",
        " \"Distract\"? They eat each other. Wha-What do you want me to do to get their attention, put on a puppet show?\n",
        " Rick, what the hell, man?! Wh-What are you, out of your mind?!\n",
        " I-I didn't do that!\n",
        " Ooh! Help! Help! \n",
        " Oh, God! Stop! Stop! This is horrible!\n",
        " Okay, no more!\n",
        " No, I don't!\n",
        " Someone, make this stop! \n",
        "  Why would you want this to happen? All you had to do was go away! Stop standing in the driveway talking about custody! And either tell her you want to stay married or get on with your life, but whatever you do, stop being a baby and act like a man! \n",
        " Rick, I-I-I think I'm breaking through to something here. C-Can we not leave just yet? \n",
        " Sorry, but can we not kill him? C-Can we just take him prisoner? \n",
        " Why does it have to be such a dramatic choice? Can't we arrange a thing where we spend weekends here or or visit home to do laundry? \n",
        " Booyah! Fuck you, pal! Who else wants some? Who wants to be my pussy of a dad today? \n",
        " Whoa, whoa!\n",
        " This isn't over, is it?\n",
        " That means, no, it isn't over, or you disapprove of the question?\n",
        " Ahh! Oh, gee! \n",
        " L-Look, man, I'm just along for the ride on this one. You know, y-y-y-y-you're preaching to the choir here.\n",
        " Uh, Armothy, can I steal you for a second? E-E-Excuse us, sir.\n",
        " You're right. We both got to see our stuff through. I got to deal with my parents' divorce, and you got to, you know, do what you got to do. I love you.\n",
        " Rick? \n",
        " Yeah, well, too late.\n",
        " Oh, but don't don't you have infinite versions of me and my sister?\n",
        " Maybe the lesson we've learned is that, whether it's our parents' marriage, a glowing green rock, or an awesome, giant arm, sooner or later, we got to let it go.\n",
        "Shit! Wh-Wh-Wh-What do I --\n",
        " Hey, there she is!\n",
        " Uh-huh.\n",
        " I got to admit, Rick, when you popped this scheme, I-I-I didn't -- I wasn't sure it was gonna work.\n",
        " You know what? Yeah. I think if Dad really wanted to be here, he'd stop at nothing to make that happen. You know, maybe Dad just doesn't want you back, or maybe he just doesn't have the strength to fight. I-In either case, he's got his life, I got mine.\n",
        " What the fuck? No. D-Do we have any oranges? I think I got a scurvy coming on.\n",
        " Rick?\n",
        " Rick?\n",
        " Rick? Are you far away, or are you inside something? \n",
        " Rick? W-where are you?\n",
        " Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?\n",
        " What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something.\n",
        " And? \n",
        " Was it?\n",
        " Are you going to, I mean, you know, is this the first part of some magic trick? \n",
        " Well, can you move? Can you fly? \n",
        " All right, well, do pickles live forever or -- \n",
        " I-I'm just trying to figure out why you would do this. Why anyone would do this.\n",
        " Rick, did you do this on purpose to get out of family counseling?\n",
        " Hey, Rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you? Also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer? And why is the time set to 10 minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy? \n",
        " Yeah, and what's courageous about eating a hot dog?\n",
        " He turned himself into a pickle.\n",
        " Oh, my God!\n",
        " I am sad that I peed. I'm sad that I peed in class instead of a toilet.\n",
        " I, I liked her.\n",
        " Oh, geez, Rick, I-I-I don't want to die! \n",
        " Who? Who was that, Rick? \n",
        " *gives a thumbs-up* Ready as I\u2019ll ever be, Rick!\n",
        " They tried to murder him first.\n",
        " Yeah, he knows. He murdered them.\n",
        " Geez. I didn\u2019t know there were still Ricks and Mortys living on the Citadel. I wonder what their day-to-day lives are like.\n",
        " Man. Glad I\u2019m not one of them!\n",
        " Mortys are human!\n",
        " WHOA!! \n",
        " Wow, Rick! That's -- That's one -- one heck of a story. I sure do wish I could have been there to see it happen.\n",
        " I kind of had big pills for lunch, and I  wasn't gonna eat any more pills.  Thank you, Conroy.\n",
        " Huh? What are you -- What are you doing? \n",
        " Summer, you're freaking me out. I know things have changed a lot, and I know you miss Rick, but getting him back wouldn't make things better. And, you know, we're not doing so bad.\n",
        " Hey, I like being 35. I-I can rent a car now.\n",
        " He bails on everybody! He bailed on Mom when she was a kid! He -- He bailed on tiny planet! And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer, he bailed on you. He left you to rot in a world that he ruined because he doesn't care! Because nobody's special to him, Summer, not even himself. So, if you really want your grandpa back, grab a shovel. The one that won't let you down is buried in your backyard! \n",
        " What?! No, I'm not right. I-I was using ghoulish overkill! Ghoulish overkill, Summer! \n",
        " Oh, God! Oh, God! Whoa, whoa! \n",
        " Summer, nobody has to know about that. We could put it right back and pretend we never saw it, like we did with Dad's mannequin leg.\n",
        " And how are you gonna do that? \n",
        " Y-You want to see what a hero Rick is? I-I'll bring you somewhere, Summer. Um- \n",
        " That's my sister. This used to be my home.\n",
        " These are the parts of Rick's adventures you don't get to see -- the parts he leaves behind. All right, it's been great, guys. I really only wanted to stop by here for a quick \"I told ya so.\" So, uh--\n",
        " What are you doing with that?! \n",
        " No! Why?! Why would you do that?! W-W-What is the matter with you people?! \n",
        " Hold your fire! Hold your fire! I'm Morty C-137.\n",
        " Summer.\n",
        " It's the Citadel of Ricks. All the different Ricks from all the different realities got together to hide here from the government.\n",
        " Because Ricks hate themselves the most. And our Rick is the most himself.\n",
        " How is this a fair trial? O-Our lawyer is a Morty.\n",
        " What? N-No, I don't want to see your Pog collection. I don't renounce Rick, and I never have. I was just trying to protect my sister. I wanted you to have a normal life. That's something you can't have when Rick shows up. Everything real turns fake. Everything right is wrong. All you know is that you know nothing and he knows everything. And, well -- well, he's not a villain, Summer, but he shouldn't be your hero. He's more like a demon or a super up god.\n",
        " Oh, yeah? If you think my Rick's dead, he's alive. And if you think you're safe, he's coming for you! \n",
        " Rick!\n",
        " R-Rick?\n",
        " That's enough! Drop the gun, Rick!\n",
        " I'm not letting you let my sister die! Drop the gun!\n",
        " Who's stupid now, bitch?!\n",
        " Ha, yeah. G-Good thing I saw that note.\n",
        " So, what are you doing with level-nine access anyways?\n",
        " Ooh, or -- or reprogram their military portals to disintegrate their entire space fleet?\n",
        " Geez! Are my parents seriously gonna get divorced? All right, Rick, I'm gonna go to my --\n",
        " Okay, take it easy, Rick. T-T-That's dark.\n",
        " Oh, geez.\n",
        " Oh \n",
        "Oh, man.\n",
        " Oh, man.\n",
        " You're gonna deny it.\n",
        " Oh.\n",
        " What are you talking about?\n",
        " Szechuan?\n",
        " McNuggets?\n",
        " What the hell?\n",
        " What are you talking about, Rick?\n",
        " What are you talking about?!\n",
        " What is that?!\n",
        " What are you talking about?!\n",
        " Woahh!\n",
        " Huh? Uh, no no no, I'm-I'm just looking at that lady getting coffee. What's up with her face? Is she a human or is she like Worf. You know Worf, from Star Trek, where he has the s*** all over his face but he's just a human in a costume, you know?\n",
        " Okay.\n",
        " Whoa! Look! It's that lady with all that s*** on her face like Worf from Star Trek! That was getting coffee! How did she get there!\n",
        " Rick, who-who is Jan-Michael Vincent?\n",
        " Is it important that we know who Jan-Michael Vincent is in order to get this?\n",
        " Excuse me, nurse, can you take my temperature? Because I think I have Jan Quadrant Vincent fever over here.\n",
        " Cool.\n",
        " This is where we\u2019re going?\n",
        " *looking at a pamphlet* Jerryboree? You created a daycare for my dad?\n",
        " I wanna come with.\n",
        " What kinda business do you do in a garage? You know, this seems a little shady.\n",
        " \u2026You sell weapons to killers for money?\n",
        " Uh, what?\n",
        " You sold a gun to a murderer so you could play video games?\n",
        " Whoa! What the hell?! Wha\u2014Where am I?! What the hell?!\n",
        " *looks around, grips his head* W\u2026 Where\u2019s my wife?\n",
        " I\u2019m Morty\u2026 You\u2019re Rick\u2026 Hey, you sold a gun to a guy that kills people!\n",
        " Don\u2019t dodge the issue, Rick! Selling a gun to a hitman is the same as pulling the trigger!\n",
        " You could stop this killing from happening, Rick! You know, y-you did a bad thing selling that gun, but you could undo it if you wanted!\n",
        " *dazed* All out of off-white Persians\u2026 *gets out of the ship and realizes he killed Krombopulos Michael* Oh man, wha-wh-wh-what have I done?! *picks up KM\u2019s arm and the antimatter gun*\n",
        " You don\u2019t understand! This guy was gonna kill someone!\n",
        " Huh?! Are you Krombopulos Michael\u2019s target? W-Wwwwhat\u2019s your name?\n",
        " Oh crap, let\u2019s get you outta here!\n",
        " *stomps past Rick* Well then I guess we\u2019re all getting in the car! Right, uh\u2026\n",
        " No! Jus-j-j-just get in the car!\n",
        " Y-You\u2019ve been clear on the fact that you don\u2019t wanna help, so just go away!\n",
        " Oooh\u2026! Come on, come on!\n",
        " *still trying to start the car* Oh no no no!\n",
        " Rick!\n",
        " Rick, we\u2019re taking him back where he belongs!\n",
        " You know, you can leave any time you want, Rick.\n",
        " That\u2019s how things should be. It\u2019s how they could be.\n",
        " I did the right thing, Rick!\n",
        " You did that!\n",
        " Whoa, whoa!\n",
        " Um, Rick!\n",
        " *not amused* Are you done?\n",
        " I\u2019m gonna miss you, um, Fart. I\u2019m really sorry your name became Fart.\n",
        " *excited* Really?\n",
        " Um\u2026 Cleansing\u2026?\n",
        " *wipes his eyes* Um\u2026 Before you go\u2026 Could you sing a\u2026 C-Could you sing for me again?\n",
        " Goodbye.\n",
        " *panicking* What?! Rick! No, you can\u2019t!\n",
        " No, no, Rick! You don\u2019t understand!\n",
        " What?!\n",
        " He's Rick's best friend.\n",
        " Wh?-Wh- th-th-that's insane!\n",
        " Hahahahaha, yeah\n",
        " You're excited about that?\n",
        " Uh, what's that?\n",
        " Rick?\n",
        " Wait! Rick, aren't these people going to barf into our mouths and absorb us?\n",
        " Look at \u2018em go! So coordinated! What\u2019s your problem? They\u2019re making you into a Mount Rushmore! They made burgers!\n",
        " Well, seems like everybody here\u2019s cool with it. Except for all those redheads. They seem like they\u2019re in a hurry to be somewhere else.\n",
        " Summer!\n",
        " Listen Unity, I don\u2019t think my sister\u2019s trying to say that life would be perfect without you. I think she\u2019s just saying that life would be\u2026 you know, life.\n",
        " Oh man! Let me help all of you guys up!\n",
        " I think you\u2019re getting what you wanted, Summer. Something\u2019s happening to Unity.\n",
        " Ah, Summer. Ha ha. First race war, huh?\n",
        " Way to go, Summer. You started a race war.\n",
        " Okay, thanks for clarifying! Y- I\u2019ll have a super accurate headstone now!\n",
        "  We\u2019re neither! S-see?\n",
        " Oh, there\u2019s no place like home! There\u2019s no place like home! Remember, Summer?\n",
        " From Dorothy and The Tiny People movie?\n",
        " All the tiny people?\n",
        " U-Unity?\n",
        " Um\u2026 should we maybe stop somewhere and get you a coffee? Maybe splash a little water on your face, or\u2026?\n",

        "  Rick! Rick!\n",
        " Uh, Rick? I think we should all go.\n",
        " This isn\u2019t healthy, Rick! Y- you know you-you\u2019re really up to no good around here. I-at-at this place,  you know?\n",

        " What the...? Cousin Nicky was a parasite?!\n",
        " This is the last time I ask you for help on my history final, Rick.\n",

        " We shall.\n",
        " Yeah, you know, he does have a lot of really weird, made-up sounding catchphrases.\n",
        " Rick, if you want to prove you're real, just do what any of the rest of us would do and -- and -- and open the blast shields and let us the hell out of here!\n",
        " Give me the gun.  I'm not doing this in front of Pencilvester. Bring him to the garage.  All right, you listen to me, you son of a bitch parasite scum. We could either do this the easy way or the hard way. You know, y-y-y-- do you want to live? Then open the blast shield doors.\n",
        " You know, Rick, this isn't easy for us. You know, w-we all remember you as a friend.\n",
        " Oh -- oh, yeah?\n",
        " I figured it out, Rick! The parasites can only create pleasant memories. I know you're real because I have a ton of bad memories with you!\n",
        " Is -- is -- isn't that what you were trying to make me understand by yelling at me?\n",
        " Everybody remain calm! This is gonna take some explaining.\n",

        " You shut up you big... female asshole!\n",
        " You didn't what?\n",
        " What's yours?\n",
        " You shut up!\n",
        " Yes no more cats, no more cats, oh you did it, you fixed it.\n",
        " Why are you doing this?\n",
        " Yes, oh, yes, yes!\n",
        " Oh, that was a close call. Oh yeah, do it Rick, do it right.\n",
        " Do the cabbage patch. Do\u2014do\u2014do the dance.\n",
        " I don't know. I think like one sixty-fourth of my collars didn't work. It's hard to keep straight now that I have sixty-three other memories of everything.\n",
        " But I feel like one of the sixty-four Ricks like, sacrificed himself for me, maybe, I think.\n",
        " Doesn't feel so good, does it?\n",
        " Uhh, where?\n",
        " Hey.\n",
        " Rick, are you really a musician?\n",
        " Me!\n",
        " B-b-but we don\u2019t have a song!\n",
        " Rick, I think we need to cut our losses. We get our family and portal out of here!\n",
        " Oh man, ok, all right, um\u2026\n",
        " Like we\u2019re not already under enough pressure! \n",
        " Rick, Ice-T, could you guys take it less easy?! We\u2019ve got six hours to come up with a song!\n",
        " Well, can we at least go get our family? You know, so we can take them with-with-with us if we lose?\n",
        " What?!\n",
        " Stop saying it like it\u2019s a thing! You made it up!\n",
        " Rick, cut it out! That\u2019s not funny, Rick!\n",
        " What?!\n",
        " That\u2019s it!\n",
        " You lied! You lied about the charge! You were just being lazy! Get back! Sit down!\n",
        " I\u2019m going to go find Mom and Dad.\n",
        " Ahhh, sh**.\n",
        " Birdperson?\n",
        " But can you help me get to my family? You know, at my house?\n",
        " All of Rick\u2019s moves are dick moves! Wh-what am I eating? What is this, bird seed?\n",
        " Tammy\u2026 gross. Birdperson, you always stick up for Rick, but he doesn\u2019t care about anyone but himself. He doesn\u2019t think about the consequences of anything he does.\n",
        " What\u2019s that? Who\u2019s that baby?\n",

Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A's in math, Morty.

        " Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty. Just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine!\n",

        " All right, let's go.\n",
        " Don't judge, Morty.\n",
        " Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea. Listen to me. If we're gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend. I'll talk to you after lunch.\n",
        " Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's the matter with you, Morty? Calm down! You're kind of killing the vibe in here.\n",

        " Geez, I don't know, Morty. Wha-what do you want from me?\n",
        " Oh, here we go!\n",
        " Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives.\n",
        " Holy crap! We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty!\n",
        " The little girl!\n",
        " Are you kidding me? This again? Oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here, Morty.\n",
        " Holy crap, Morty. He can travel through dreams. He can travel through dreams! We're so screwed!\n",
        " What are we here for again? Incepting? We're trying to incept-\n",
        " Oh, yeah.\n",
        " Hold on, Morty. Y-you know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can hide. I say we try hiding.\n",
        " Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything?\n",
        " Worst-case scenario we're back to running.\n",
        " Thanks, Morty. Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while.\n",
        " Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look at that. He's getting sleepy. Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day. That's when we make our move.\n",
        " Morty, this is perfect. After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him.\n",
        " Looks like scary Terry's having a nightmare.\n",
        " Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap. Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants?\n",
        " You're putting too much pressure on yourself, scary Terry. You know, I mean, y-you're perfectly scary enough as it is.\n",
        " You're our boy, dawg. Don't even trip.\n",
        " As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with.\n",
        " Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty?\n",
        " Well, it's possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty.\n",
        " Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer.\n",
        " If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over.\n",
        " It's all over, Jerry.\n",
        " Ooh, great plan, Jerry.\n",
        " No, no, no, I was just playing dead. Good news, though, Morty. This whole thing's gonna be over really soon.\n",
        " It's a dream, Morty. We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles' dream.\n",
        " It's been six hours. Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So, you know, every day here is like a minute. It's like \"Inception,\" Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie.\n",
        " No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty. You're sleeping in your crap right now. Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. I mean, it's a mess out there. I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth.\n",
        " Look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, Morty. Here, here take these, Morty. Take these.\n",
        " Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.\n",
        " It's necessary for the plan, Morty. Don't even trip, dawg.\n",
        " I think it will be great, Morty. You know it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages. I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop. You know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven.\n",
        " What do you know, Morty? What do you know?\n",
        " Oooh! This is how you dream, bitch. \n",
        " Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.\n",
        " It is.\n",
        " Oh, there's no need to do that, Beth. Regular pancakes are fine.\n",
        " Oh, I get it. Regular pancakes are already shaped like flying saucers.  Mmm, I should be making you breakfast for putting up with me.\n",
        " That\u2019ll keep \u2018em  busy for a while.\n",
        " \u2018Course not, Morty! How could that profit me? Someone out there is killing Ricks, and the council ain\u2019t gonna stop thinking it\u2019s me until we clear our names.\n",
        " By finding the real Rick killer.\n",
        " Not really my style, Morty. Besides, your home is most likely swarming with Ricks right now.\n",
        " The Ricks are probably gonna waste some time messing with Jerry. They won\u2019t be able to help themselves. But as soon as they get bored they\u2019ll be on to us.\n",
        " Yeah, more phonesticks please.\n",
        " Yeah, it\u2019s gotta be that way. You\u2019re a camouflage.\n",
        " Ricks have a very distinct and traceable brainwave due to our genius. The best way to hide from an enemy\u2019s radar is to stand near someone with complementary brainwaves that make ours invisible. See, wh-wh-when a Rick is with a Morty, the genius waves get cancelled out by the uh,  Morty waves.\n",
        " Oh, shit dog! My portal gun was hacked remotely Morty, obviously by the real killer to frame me. But I was able to trace the signal. Come on, let\u2019s go!\n",
        " Hey, it\u2019s a good thing that space outlet had labcoats and your favourite kind of shirt in stock, huh Morty?\n",
        " Man, this place is wayyy off the grid. This guy does not wanna be found.\n",
        " Morty, you\u2019re making a bigger deal out of this than it is.\n",
        " Not people, Morty. Mortys.\n",
        " Well, one Morty\u2019s enough to hide from the bureaucrats. But you g- you get a whole matrix of Mortys and put \u2018em in agonising pain. That creates a pattern that can hide even from other Ricks, motherfucker. I fiddled with a  concept like this once.\n",
        " On paper, Morty, on paper! I wouldn\u2019t do this, it\u2019s barbaric overkill. I mean, you could accomplish the same result with like five Mortys and a jumper cable.  Which I also wouldn\u2019t do! I\u2019m just saying, it\u2019s bad craftsmanship.\n",
        " Hey, it\u2019s your choice to take it personally, Morty. Now for the love of god, be quiet! The point of this is to get the drop on the guy!\n",
        " Yeah, that\u2019s right! You are! You\u2019re a perfect impenetrable sheet of human armour, Morty! Because you\u2019re as dumb as I am smart! Which is why when I say \u2018shut up\u2019 it\u2019s really good advice.\n",
        " Great, nice work, Morty.\n",
        " Urrgh.\n",
        " The slow clap? Really? Kinda played out, dude.\n",
        " Well lah-dee-dah. \n",
        " I don\u2019t like the look of that Rick, Morty. We gotta escape.\n",
        " Don\u2019t be Rickdiculous, Morty.\n",
        " Yeah, yeah, looks like payday at Neverland ranch in here. Zing!\n",
        " That guy got it.\n",
        " Hey, I\u2019ll take it over Mumford and Sons. Zip!\n",
        " This guy is on it!\n",
        " Awww.\n",
        " Yeah, duh!\n",
        " I get it. So you want me to team up with you to take down the council of Ricks, right? Is that where you\u2019re going with this? \u2018Cause that\u2019s where I\u2019d be going.\n",
        " No, I\u2019m just allergic to dipshits.\n",
        " Morty! Get me out of this! Come on!\n",
        " Point taken, but this is  no time for arcs.\n",
        " Uh, guys? Not a good time. Come on, Morty, let\u2019s hit it.\n",
        " Alright, Morty, don\u2019t break an arm jerking yourself off.\n",
        " Hey Morty, you want connection? Go be part of some stupid club like all those dumb Ricks. You know, maybe I don\u2019t connect because I\u2019m the Rickest Rick there is. And you know, it would  go without saying that the Rickest Rick\u2026 would have the Mortyest Morty.\n",
        " Yeah, it would. Did you hear me say it?\n",
        " Just don\u2019t get too big for your loafers, Buster Brown. A cocky Morty could lead to some big problems. Could be a real bad thing for everybody.\n",
        " I-I-I\u2019ll explain when you\u2019re older.\n",
        " Wubbalubbadubdub! Oh. Hey Jerry. Wh-wh-what are you doing in my room, buddy?\n",
        " Alright. Okay, get out.\n",
        " What\u2019s that dipshit doing out there? Are you friends with him? You know he eats his own shit, right? Oh my god, this is rich! I\u2019ve got like  ten Ricks to call right now!\n",
        " *offscreen* Ho ho ho, everybody.\n",
        " Calm down Jerry, this is Ruben, an old friend.\n",
        " I check in on him once a year and give him a little *burp* medical *burp* evaluation.\n",
        " Don\u2019t worry about your C-C-Christmas, Jerry. *leads Ruben away* Ruben and I\u2019ll be in my workshop while you have another day in Phil Collins\u2019 proverbial paradise.\n",
        " Hi Joyce, Leonard. *looks at Jacob* Hello there.\n",
        " Morty! A moment of your time?\n",
        " He\u2019s in bad shape, Morty.\n",
        " Gee, thanks Morty. What kind of monster do you think I am? I-I\u2019m sittin\u2019 here trying to save the guy\u2019s life!  I want you to find Dr. Xenon Bloom. He\u2019ll know what\u2019s goin\u2019 on.\n",
        " In Ruben. *shoves a glass oxygen mask onto Morty\u2019s head*\n",
        " Ruben on the table, Morty! *hooks up the backpack to the helmet* Look, I-I don\u2019t have time for you to wrap your little walnut around everything. *pulls a shrink ray into view and plugs it in* Hold your breath until the process is over or your lungs will collapse.\n",
        " He\u2019s busy.\n",
        " *adjusts his own headset as he stands in the garage* Depending on my aim, you should be just south of the entrance.\n",
        " Welcome, Morty.  Welcome\u2026  \u2026to Anatomy Park!\n",
        " It\u2019s a little business venture I\u2019ve been cookin\u2019 up on the side with Dr. Bloom.  An amusement park inside a human body. Science isn\u2019t cheap, Morty. This should really help put a dent in the overhead.\n",
        " You got a problem with that last one, Morty?\n",
        " Okay, alright, if I sounded a little defensive, it\u2019s because Pirates of the Pancreas was my baby.\n",
        " I-I got a lot of push-back when I pitched it, Morty. I guess I\u2019m still a little defensive. Let\u2019s just find Dr. Bloom, alright? I-I\u2019m picking up a distress signal in the liver, Morty.\n",
        " Proceed to the liver.\n",
        " Liver\u2019s under maintenance. Ruben\u2019s seen some rough years, Morty. Don\u2019t judge. You don\u2019t agree to have a theme park built inside you if your life\u2019s going great.\n",
        " No no, Morty. The only monster here is alco\u2014 *belch* \u2014holism.  That is an animatronic werewolf.\n",
        " Hey Bloom, it\u2019s Rick. What the hell\u2019s goin\u2019 on here?\n",
        " Watch it.\n",
        " Just take a deep breath, Ruben.\n",
        " Oh, great work, Morty. *pulls a massive syringe form his lab coat* I\u2019ll just cure it, and then\u2014\n",
        " Okay. Well I can\u2019t cure death. This is bad, Morty. You\u2019re trapped in a dead man. Listen, if the situation keeps darkening, do yourself a favor\u2014\n",
        " \u2014and hop by Pirates of the Pancreas. Obviously I\u2019m biased, but, I think it\u2019s great, Morty.\n",
        " *sitting in a lounge chair, pulls out a flask* It\u2019s a bunch of pirates runnin\u2019 around a-a-a- pancreas. We don\u2019t whitewash it either, Morty. The pirates are really rapey. The top priority is to get you guys out of there, but I\u2019m just saying, if that becomes impossible\u2014\n",
        " \u2014please, you gotta treat yourself.\n",
        " I\u2019m trying to concentrate.\n",
        " *holds up a hand without even looking over at him* Not now, Jerry. I\u2019ve got much, much smaller fish to fry.\n",
        " Relative\u2026 That\u2019s it! Relative size! Jerry, hand me a scalpel and a bundle of dynamite! *into his headset* Morty! Can you get to the left nipple?\n",
        " I\u2019m almost there, Morty!\n",
        " Where\u2019s Dr. Bloom?\n",
        " Goddamn it, Morty, I ask you to do one thing!\n",
        " Too bad about Dr. Bloom. *Rick, Annie, and Morty exit the car* He was a genius. The only man capable of creating a new Anatomy Park.\n",
        " What about Pirates of the Pancreas\u2026?\n",
        " Booyah! Hold your breath!\n",
        " Yeah, so I heard. You dodged a bullet, Morty, trust me. *whispers* Puffy vagina.\n",
        " C\u2019mon. Let\u2019s get some stuffing, I\u2019m starving.\n",
        " Oh, unbelievable. We got a bunch of robot computer people sittin\u2019 around with their faces stuffed in computer screens.  Do you realize Christ was born today? Jesus Christ our Savior was born today! A-A-A-Are you people even human? What kind of Christmas is this?\n",
        " Loud and clear, Annie.\n",
        " Hey everybody.\n",
        " Yeah, talk to me.\n",
        " Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit, Ethan! They\u2019re inside you building a monument to compromise! Fuck. Fuck those people. Fuck this whole thing, Ethan.\n",
        " Whatever.\n",
        " Well, scientifically, traditions are an idiot thing.\n",
        " Pass the butter.\n",
        " Thank you.\n",
        " I\u2019m busy.\n",
        " Uh, anything else?\n",
        " You pass butter.\n",
        " Yeah, welcome to the club, pal.\n",
        " Since when did you have a job?\n",
        " Wee-ow, can\u2019t wait to meet this fascinating character.\n",
        "  Huh.\n",
        " Eh, I make my own stuff. So what are you, like, the devil?\n",
        " I dunno, store comes out of nowhere, all the shit\u2019s old and creepy; are you the devil? A demon? Leprechaun?\n",
        " Hey, I\u2019m not judging. I just like to shoot straight. I\u2019m a man of science.\n",
        " Hahahahaha.\n",
        " Hey, Morty, lemme ask you a question real quick. Does evil exist, and if so, can one detect and measure it?\n",
        " Rhetorical question Morty. The answer is yes, you just have to be a genius.\n",
        " Your sister\u2019s boss gave me a microscope that would have made me retarded.\n",
        " Uh, Morty, I\u2019m not disparaging the differently abled. I\u2019m stating the fact that if I had used this microscope, it would have made me mentally retarded.\n",
        " Well that\u2019s retarded.\n",
        " Apparently nothing.\n",
        " It\u2019s not.\n",
        " Whoa.\n",
        " Stay scientific, Jerry.\n",
        " This serum should counteract the negative effects.\n",
        "  Here. You can have this back.\n",
        " Sure I did. To develop this. It detects and catalogues all your Twilight Zone Ray Bradbury Friday the 13th of series voodoo crap magic. I thought you might want it so you didn\u2019t accidentally sell anybody, say,  a typewriter that generates best-selling murder mysteries, then makes the murders happen in real life? Oooh.\n",
        " Don\u2019t you want to make sure people know what they\u2019re getting? You\u2019re not intentionally selling  beauty cream that makes ugly ladies pretty but also makes them blind?\n",
        " Oh, I say, good sir! Oh, harrumph, oh, oh, bobba-doppa-doopa-bo-bo.  That\u2019s beautiful, you know it\u2019s going to be wearing you in three hours?\n",
        " Here, you can use my phone. Don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t make you deaf because I\u2019m not a hack.\n",

        " You work for the devil!\n",
        " Whoops.\n",
        " Looks like we\u2019ve got\u2026 haunted boxing gloves that will make you the heavyweight champion, in 1936 and then you\u2019ll be trapped there winning the same fight for eternity. I can take out the eternity, and the padding, and then you\u2019ll have some time travelling mittens.\n",
        " Oh, look, it\u2019s Rosemary\u2019s baby! How\u2019s business?\n",
        " Sounds like code for \u2018You win, Rick!\u2019\n",
        " Nope, it was important to your dumb devil friend. To me this was all just a bit like when Bugs Bunny fucks with the opera singer for twenty minutes.\n",
        " Seriously? Holy crap. Holy crap.\n",
        " Uh huh, yeah, I don\u2019t care.\n",
        " So?\n",
        " I always do.\n",
        " Yeah, it is good. It\u2019s the best.\n",
        " Later!\n",
        " Yeah, uh, gimmie a sec.\n",
        " Alright, yeah, uh, put \u2018em on my\u2026 eh.\n",
        " I just got bored. Everybody out.\n",
        "  Hey Morty, you wanna go on a- oh.  Hey Beth? Hello?  Hey Jerry, you in here being stupid? \n",
        " Thanks. Hey, y\u2019know, I was thinking I might watch a movie\u2026\n",
        " Suit yourself.\n",
        " Hey!  Hey. What\u2019s going on?\n",
        " Whatever.\n",
        " How\u2019s your pretend grandpa doing AKA the devil?\n",
        " Oof, sorry.\n",
        " Hm, not sure.\n",
        " No, that\u2019s dumb.\n",
        " I\u2019ll tell you what though, if it\u2019s satisfaction you\u2019re after, I think I might have an idea. \n",
        " Stupid mother-\n",
        " Stupid motherfucker!\n",
        " How do you like that! Augh! How do you like that?\n",
        " We did it!\n",
        " Was totally worth it! We did it, hahaha! We just pulled it off!\n",
        " Hahaha!\n",
        "  I should get her pregnant, then she'll have to marry me. \n",
        "  Sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school.  I'm not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty, his marriage is hanging from a thread.\n",
        " Jerry, it's your house, whatever you say it is is how it is,  but I think a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door. I barely have a reason to care and even I noticed.\n",
        " Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call \"love\" is a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it, your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science. \n",
        "  Morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh? *Morty closes door* I'm almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, Morty. It's gonna be great.\n",
        " Morty, that's such a poor use of my time, it's beneath me. Hand me the screwdriver. \n",
        " *sighs* You're growing up fast, Morty. You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass!  Listen, this is called oxytocin. I extracted it from a vole. You know what a VOLE is, Morty, you know what a vole is?\n",
        " It's a, it's a rodent that mates for life, Morty. This is the chemical release in the mammal's brain,  ...that makes it fall in love. Alright Morty, I just gotta *burps* combine it with some of your DNA.\n",
        " A hair, Morty, I need one of your hairs! This isn't Game Of Thrones. \n",
        "  Alright, Morty, whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever. Ya happy now, Morty?\n",
        " Www.. what am I, a hack?! Go nuts, Morty, it's full proof.\n",
        " Ugh, unless she has the flu. \n",
        " Well, does it defraculate?\n",
        " Then -- then -- then it's a broken defraculator,\n",
        " Yeah, yeah, and your species eat sulfur, So, let's say 60 smidgens, I tell you what -- I'll do you a favor, I'll throw in a fart,\n",
        " Not here, Morty, We'll stop somewhere else, because, you know, there's always another pawn shop,\n",
        " Oh, it looks cool, huh?\n",
        " Okay, 60 for the resonator, and my grandson wants the sex robot,\n",
        " I don't know,\n",
        "\n",
        " Strange -- that's usually the man's job,\n",
        " All right, Uh-oh,\n",
        " Hmm, I think Morty's robot was designed for more than long weekends,\n",
        " Hey, listen -- you guys quarantined the house when Summer brought olives back from Mexico,\n",
        " Don't name it,\n",
        " Fine, I'm gonna take this thing to my workshop and do a little bit of investigating,\n",
        " Yeah, Good one, Jerry,\n",
        " Well, I can't solve the problem my way, thanks to your family's primitive biological hang-ups,\n",
        " I don't do adventures with chicks, Summer,\n",
        " Oh, crap,\n",
        " Great, Now I have to take over a whole planet because of your stupid boobs,\n",
        " Thanks, dum-dum,\n",
        "\n",
        " Look, I'm trying to repair a p-portal gun with a bunch of sex-doll parts, and I have to do it one-handed to keep these belushis from carting you off,\n",
        " Obviously, at some point, the Gazorpians became so evolved that they replaced females with birthing machines,\n",
        " You ever see a line for the men's room?\n",
        " The plot thickens,\n",
        "\n",
        " Aaaah!\n",
        " Well, obviously, Summer, it appears the lower tier of this society is being manipulated through sex and advanced technology by a hidden ruling class,\n",
        " Oh, there -- there we go, Summer,\n",
        " \n",
        " \n",
        " Wait a minute, We're here because a male Gazorpian was born on our planet,\n",
        "\n",
        " Yeah, You know what I have to say about that?\n",
        " \n",
        " It's not dominated by us, okay?\n",
        " Was this really the time to make that point, Summer?\n",
        " Because I got --\n",
        " Pfft!\n",
        " What, what, what -- a night on the couch?\n",
        "\n",
        " What? Just give me a gun,\n",
        " Look, I'm sorry, Summer,\n",
        " Good job, Summer, and thanks, girls,\n",
        " Out of the -- out of the way, Morty!\n",
        " Isn't it interesting,\n",
        " No, I'd say, given what we've been through, that I was right the whole time and any epiphanies about gender politics were a projection of your feminine insecurity,\n",
        " Oh, that's interesting,\n",
        " T-t-t-this is just sloppy craftsmanship.\n",
        " Oh, yes, Morty. It's almost unbelievable, isn't it?\n",
        " Oh, sure, buddy. Yeah. Sure. B-brilliant. Very convincing.\n",
        " Oh! Responsive, too! In real time! I love it!\n",
        " Oh, what's with Mom? So, you're saying that she's acting weird? How soph\u2014*burp*\u2014isticated. Careful, guys. You're gonna burn out the CPU with this one.\n",
        " Whatever, quote-unquote \u201cMorty.\u201d\n",
        " *spying from outside* Interesting\u2026\n",
        " *kicks open the door* Morty, u-uh, come on. There's a family emergency.\n",
        " He doesn't care.\n",
        " Take a shower with me, Morty.\n",
        " Listen to me, Morty. Get your clothes off and get in the shower right now. *strips* Y-y-y-you got to trust me, Morty.\n",
        " Morty, that's not class. T-t-t-that wasn't your teacher. This isn't your school. This entire world is not the world. We're inside a huge simulation chamber on an alien spaceship.\n",
        " It\u2019s all fake *burps* Morty, all of it. Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of\u2026 crazy, fake nonsense, Morty. I couldn't say so until we got in the shower. They won't monitor us in here.\n",
        " Zigerion scammers, Morty. The galaxy's most ambitious, least successful con artists. You know, it's lucky for us they're also really uncomfortable with nudity.\n",
        " I can\u2019t let you do that, Morty.\n",
        " No! You give it to me!\n",
        " Morty, come on! Morty!\n",
        " Uhp, uhp, uhp! Morty, keep your hands off your ding-dong! It's the only way we can speak freely. Look around you, Morty. Do you really think this world is real? You'd have to be an idiot not to notice all the sloppy details. Look, that guy's putting a bun between two hot dogs.\n",
        " Well, look at that old lady. She's, she's walking a cat on a leash.\n",
        " Look, I-I-I don't wanna hear about Mrs. Spencer, Morty! She's an idiot! Alright, alright, there. W-what about that, Morty?\n",
        " Oh, really, Morty? Are you sure you haven't seen that somewhere in real life before?\n",
        " You're missing the point, Morty. Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels? I mean, does your car look like a smaller version of your house? No.\n",
        " Well, that would be obvious to you, Morty, if you'd been paying attention.\n",
        " Yeah, it's a special fuel I invented to travel through space faster than anybody else. These Zigerions are always trying to scam me out of my secrets, but they made a big mistake this time, Morty. They dragged you into this. Now they're gonna pay!\n",
        " We'll scam the scammers, Morty. And we're gonna take them for everything they've got.\n",
        " Morty, relax. It's just a bunch of 1s and 0s out there. You're gonna be fine.  Just follow my lead.  Yo, deejay, drop that beat.\n",
        " Uh-oh, Morty. This crowd looks too small for one of our famous rap concerts. I don't think we can perform our new song, \"The Recipe for Concentrated Dark Matter,\" for a crowd this tiny.\n",
        " Now that\u2019s more like it! Morty, here we go. Let me hear everybody say \"hey-oh!\" yeah!  All the ladies say, \"yeah!\"  Everybody over thirty, do this with your hands! Everybody with a red shirt, jump up and down! \n",
        " Yo, everyone whose first name begins with an \"L\" who isn't Hispanic, walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times ten!  Run, Morty! Before the system reboots!\n",
        " Out of the simulation, Morty. Normally, the chamber operates like a treadmill, with the virtual world disappearing behind us and being rendered in front of us as we move through it, but while it's frozen, Morty, we can get to\u2026the edge. Here we go. *jumps off the edge*\n",
        " Come on, Morty.\n",
        " Keep your eyes peeled for the central processing room, Morty. That's how we're gonna scam these idiots.\n",
        " It's an obsession for them at this point. The Zigerions have been trying to outsmart me for years, Morty. Every time they do, I'm one step ahead of them. *finds central processing room* Aha! Here we go. *starts collecting chips* Grab as many processors as you can carry, Morty. These guys aren't good at much, but they're really good at making these chips.\n",
        " Don't worry about it, Morty. There's plenty of them, you little goofball.  Come here, Morty! Oh, I gotcha!\n",
        " Nothing wrong with just a little bit of horseplay every now and then, little fella.\n",
        " Totes malotes, dawg.\n",
        " Believe it, Morty. And once again, I'm flying away with everything I can carry, and the Zigerions got nothing of mine.\n",
        " Get in, Morty. I'm gonna be able to use these processors to make some real important science stuff.  Huh. I thought I entered the code right. \n",
        " Uhh\u2026\n",
        " Uh, yeah, until I get home before you and change the combination, you bunch of idiots!\n",
        " RUN MORTY!\n",
        " Jerry?!\n",
        " What are you doing here? W-why are you dressed like a waiter? Screw it. We don't have time. Come on. *starts dragging Jerry with them*\n",
        " Man up, Jerry! I may need you to work the lasers.\n",
        " I guess they really do have concentrated dark matter.\n",
        " Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, check the engine room. We just need cesium, Plutonic quarks, and bottled water.\n",
        " Wow, Morty. Lucky break. Grab that bucket. Okay, two parts Plutonic quarks, one part cesium.\n",
        " Now empty the water bottle into the bucket and pour it all into the fuel tank so we can get the hell out of here! What are you doing, Morty?! There's no time!\n",
        " Oh, no.\n",
        " No!\n",
        " You simulated my grandson's genitalia?! Y-y-you bunch of diabolical sons of bitches!\n",
        " All right. Okay. All right, great. Wonderful. You win. Can we go home now?\n",
        " Hey, Jerry, don't worry about it. So what if the most meaningful day of your life was a simulation operating at minimum capacity?\n",
        " Maybe you're right, Jerry. Maybe you're right.\n",
        " Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh, yeah. You can't. They blew up.\n",
        " Hey, Morty.\n",
        " Hey, little buddy. H-h-how you doing in here right now?\n",
        " Y-y-you're a good kid, Morty. Y-you're a real l-little c-character, Morty.\n",
        " You know, I had a really rocky road today, M-Morty. You're my little friend, aren't you? We had some good times together, huh, M-Morty? We You're a real true hero out in the field. You're a... You're a real trouper, huh, M-M-Morty?\n",
        " I really appreciate you, Morty.\n",
        " *suddenly aggressive, holds a knife to Morty\u2019s throat* You little son of a bitch! Y-y- are you a simulation?! Huh?! Are you a simulation?!\n",
        " You little son of a bitch!\n",
        " I-I-I\u2019m sorry, Morty. Y-you're a good\u2026 You're a good kid, Morty.\n",
        " Y-you're a good\u2026 You're a good kid. *passes out*\n",
        " *snores*\n",
        "  Morty! You gotta come on. Jus'... you gotta come with me.\n",
        " I got a surprise for you, Morty.\n",
        "  Come on, I got a surprise for you.  Come on, hurry up. \n",
        " We gotta go, gotta get outta here, come on. Got a surprise for you Morty.\n",
        "  What do you think of this... flying vehicle, Morty? I built it outta stuff I found in the garage.\n",
        " Morty. I had to... I had to do it. I had\u2014 I had to\u2014 I had to make a bomb, Morty. I had to create a bomb.\n",
        " We're gonna drop it down there just get a whole fresh start, Morty. Create a whole fresh start.\n",
        " Come on, Morty. Just take it easy, Morty. It's gonna be good. Right now, we're gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica.\n",
        "  When I drop the bomb you know, I want you to have somebody, you know? I want you to have the thing. I'm gonna make it like a new Adam and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam.\n",
        " And Jessica's gonna be Eve.\n",
        " And so that's the surprise, Morty.\n",
        " I-I get what you're trying to say, Morty. Listen, I'm not...  You don't got... Y-you don\u2019t gotta worry about me trying to fool around with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything. I'm not that kind of guy, Morty.\n",
        " You-you don't have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything. Sh-sh-she\u2014 she, she, she's all for you, Morty.\n",
        " You know what, Morty? You're right.  Let's forget the girl altogether. She, she's probably nothing but trouble, anyways. \n",
        " Get off of me, Morty! \n",
        "  Come on! What\u2019s gotten into you? If you love Earth so much why don\u2019t you marry it?  What are you, crazy? Alright, alright, Morty. \n",
        " Alright. I'll-I'll land. I'll land. I'll land. I'll land the thing. I\u2019ll land the thing. Big tough guy all of a sudden.\n",
        "  We'll park it right here, Morty. Right here on the side of the ree... road here.\n",
        " You know what? That was all a test, Morty. Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive.\n",
        " Sure. Why not? I don\u2019t, I don't know. Y-you know what, Mo\u2014 \n",
        " What, so everyone's supposed to sleep every single night now? You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time?\n",
        " Mm, there is no God, Summer. You gotta rip that band-aid off now. You'll thank me later.\n",
        " Listen, Jerry. I-I-I don't want to overstep my bounds or anything. It's your house. It's your world. You're a real Julius Caesar but I'll tell you something\u2014tell you how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time.  Buncha people running around, bumping into each other. G-guy up front says, \"two plus two.\" The people in the back say, \"four.\" Then the\u2014then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something. I mean, it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. And I know that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue.  This was a good breakfast, Beth. You really made the crap out of those eggs. I wish your mother was here to eat them. \n",
        " There you are, Morty. Listen to me. I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension. I need an extra pair of hands.\n",
        " It's pretty obvious, Morty. I froze him. Now listen I need your help, Morty. I mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business.  It's important. Come on, Morty.\n",
        " Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty? What do you think I can just do it all by myself? Come on!\n",
        " I'll do it later, Morty. He'll be fine. Let's go. \n",
        " There she is. All right. Come on, Morty. Let's go.\n",
        " It's Dimension 35-C, and it's got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, Morty, called a Mega Tree, and there's fruit in those trees, and there's seeds in those fruits. I'm talking about Mega Seeds. They're they're incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty.\n",
        " All right, all right, calm down. Listen to me, Morty. I know that new situations can be intimidating. You're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that's how we grow as people. I'm no stranger to scary situations. I deal with them all the time. Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we're gonna be\u2014 \n",
        " HOLY CRAP, MORTY RUN!!! \n",
        " I never seen that thing before in my life. I don't even know what the hell it is! We got to get out of here, Morty! It's gonna kill us! We're gonna die! We're gonna die, Morty!\n",
        "  Oh, Morty, take a deep breath. Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Morty. Y-you smell that? That's the smell of adventure, Morty. That's that's the smell of-of-of-of a whole different evolutionary timeline.\n",
        " Are you joking me? I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us. Look at that thing right there.  What the hell is that thing? You think you're gonna see that kind of thing at school?  Look at it just lumbering around.  It defies all logic, that thing.\n",
        " Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Morty, you see this? \n",
        " You see what we just stumbled upon, Morty? Any idea what that is down there?\n",
        " That's right, Morty the mega trees with the mega fruit on them and that's what I'm talking about, Morty. That's where my seeds are. If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have found them, because you're so in love with school.\n",
        " You ask a lot of questions, Morty. Not very charismatic. It makes you kind of an  under-  underfoot figure. \n",
        " Just take these shoes, Morty. They're  special grappling shoes. When you're wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty up, down, below, turn around to the left. These things really bring it all together.\n",
        " You have to turn them on, Morty! The shoes have to be turned on!\n",
        "  Morty, oh, you really d-did a number on  your legs right now. You know, you got to turn  the shoes on, Morty, for them to work. Yeah, look I turned mine on. I had no problem getting down here. It was a leisurely breeze.\n",
        " Yeah, I can see that. But do you think you'll still be able to help me collect my seeds, Morty?\n",
        " Okay, hold on just a second, Morty. \n",
        " Don't worry about it, Morty. Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy?\n",
        " Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore.  The stuff was all over the place, Morty.\n",
        " There's just one problem, Morty one little hang-up. The dimension I visited was so advanced, that  they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever. I was the only old person there, Morty.  It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. I-I was fascinating to them. There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they-they-they\u2014 they all wanted time with me. I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it's got no charge left, Morty. It's got no charge left.\n",
        " It's as good as garbage, Morty. It's not gonna work anymore, Morty.\n",
        " There's ways to get back home, Morty. It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. We're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you're gonna have to do me a real solid.\n",
        " When we get to customs, I'm gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty.\n",
        " Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit.\n",
        " Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty. Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs unless they're in someone's rectum, Morty\n",
        " And they'll fall right out of mine. I've done this too many times, Morty. I mean, you're young. Y-y-you've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable. You got to do it for grandpa, Morty. Y-  you've got to put these seeds inside your butt.\n",
        " Come on, Morty. Please, Morty. You have to do it, Morty.\n",
        "  I don't like it here, Morty. I can't abide bureaucracy. I don't like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt?\n",
        " That means they're good ones. You're a good kid, Morty. Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work. You've been a huge help to me. I'm gonna be able to do a-\n",
        " Why does he have to go over there?\n",
        " What new-  what new machine?\n",
        " Run, Morty! Run! \n",
        " Don't think about it! \n",
        " Ooh! Oh, nice, Morty! The student becomes the teacher. \n",
        " I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty. Cover me. \n",
        " They're just robots, Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're robots! \n",
        " It's a figure of speech, Morty. They're bureaucrats. I don't respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty. You have no idea what prison is like here! \n",
        " Come on, Morty! We got to get the hell out of here! \n",
        " You can get his number later. Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here. You got to get those seeds out of your ass. \n",
        " Oh, hi, Jerry. Oh, my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class? We talked about this. Your-your parents and I are very disappointed in-in this behavior... No? No takers? \n",
        " You guys should really not be touching that stuff. It's beyond your reasoning.\n",
        " Takes one to know one.\n",
        " What what are you guys doing with my stuff?\n",
        " A nursing home? What are what are you, nuts? I'm a genius. I build robots for fun.\n",
        " What are you trying to say about Morty? That he's stupid or something?\n",
        " I-I-I don't know what you mean by that. Can can can you be a little bit more specific?\n",
        " Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi.\n",
        " The square root of Pi, Morty. Go!\n",
        " Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics.\n",
        " I told the both of you school is stupid. It's not how you learn things. Morty's a gifted child. He has a special mind. That's why he's my little helper. He's like me. He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. He's too smart for school. He needs to keep hanging out and helping me.\n",
        " Okay, Jerry. You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say no? You-you really wear the pants around here. I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it's gonna be clear communication. \n",
        " No idea what you're talking about. \n",
        " Full disclosure, Morty it's not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity.\n",
        " Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty.\n",
        " I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more adventures.  And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty and you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty but if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. Morty's things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long, forever. All a hundred days. Rick and Morty forever 100 times. Over and over, rickandmortyadventures.com. All 100 years. Every minute, rickandmorty.com.\n",
        " Run!\n",
        " Morty, do it! Hit the button now!\n",
        " *holding off the clones* Morty, I already told you, it\u2019s not your family! They\u2019re clones from an alternate reality possessed by demonic alien spirits from another dimension\u2019s future! Do you need a mnemonic device or something? Just hit the button already!\n",
        " Good work, Morty.\n",
        " *holding up the device and smiling* Y-You know, these demonic alien spirits are really valuable!\n",
        " You okay, Morty? Told you not to trust that tuna.\n",
        " I dunno, Morty. Some people would pay top dollar for that kinda breakthrough.\n",
        " Whoa whoa whoa, *grabs Morty\u2019s shoulder, stopping him* come on, Morty! D-D-Don\u2019t be like that! The universe is a crazy and chaotic place!\n",
        " Oh yeah, Morty. Yeah, t-t-that- that\u2019s real easy to say from the sidekick position. But\u2014But, uh, h-how about next time you be in charge, then we\u2019ll talk about how simple and fun it is.\n",
        " Okay, fine. But let\u2019s make it interesting, Morty. I-I-If your adventure sucks, and we bail halfway through it, you lose the right to bitch about all future adventures. Plus, you have to do my laundry for a month.\n",
        " Every 10th.\n",
        " Washing dishes?\n",
        " Yeah just don't do it.\n",
        " Wow. Hat trick. All right, Morty, let's put a pin in this. I got to help your pathetic family.\n",
        " Oh, Morty, you done did it this time. It's on. I can't wait to watch your adventure lay a huge fart. As for you dingdongs... This is a Meeseeks box. Let me show you how it works. You press this.\n",
        " You make a request. Mr. Meeseeks, open Jerry's stupid mayonnaise jar.\n",
        " The Meeseeks fulfills the request.\n",
        " And then it stops existing.\n",
        " Trust me, they're fine with it. Knock yourselves out just keep your requests simple. They're not gods.\n",
        " God, Morty, what a boring start to an adventure. Why didn't we just go to Kentucky?\n",
        " Can't wait.\n",
        " Oh, my God, so embarrassing.\n",
        " Yeah. Beginner's luck.\n",
        " All right, Morty. We're in your stupid giant's castle. What do we do next?\n",
        " Just give up, Morty. This is game over. I'll take us home right now. You just say the word.\n",
        " Oh, boy. He looks pretty bad down there, Morty. Looks like he's bleeding out.\n",
        " Ooh, boy, Morty, you're really showing me how it's done. Real straightforward and fun.\n",
        " How? They took my portal gun. This is an open-and-shut case, Morty. You know, what do you think's gonna happen, some magical angel's gonna show up and then-\n",
        " W-what the hell is he talking about?\n",
        " All right, Morty, looks like the portal gun's still working. You ready to head home?\n",
        " Morty, cut your losses. This is obviously awash.\n",
        " Oh, boy, Morty.\n",
        " What do you say, Morty?\n",
        " Yeah, Morty, this is the part of the story everybody loves scaling down 650,000 oversized steps.\n",
        " What are you looking at, mother-\n",
        " Yeah, yeah, yeah, how about some scotch whiskey? You got any of that around here? Or just a bunch of nonsense words?\n",
        " 25 shmeckels? I don't know how much I don't know what that is. Is that a lot? Is it a little?\n",
        " Morty, your adventure's in a spiral. For real, man, time to pull out.\n",
        " Uh, because it's lame?\n",
        " Whatever.\n",
        " \u266a Sweet home Alabama \u266a\n",
        " Read 'em and weep, fellas!  Oh, hey, Morty. Listen, I'm really sorry about all that stuff I said earlier about your adventure. I'm havin' a good time, Morty. It's not so bad.\n",
        " We can't leave now, Morty. I'm on fire!\n",
        " Okay. Listen, Morty. I just won a bunch of shmeckels. Why don't we use 25 of them to pay slippery stair here for a ride back to the village, and then we'll give the rest of the shmeckels to the villagers, huh?\n",
        " Sure, Morty. Yeah. You know, a good adventure needs a good ending.\n",
        " Good job, Morty. Looks like you won the bet.\n",
        " Well, you know, maybe that's why it could use a little cleaning up every now and then, you know. This one's wrapped up neat and clean because we did it Morty style.\n",
        " What the hell happened to this place?\n",
        " Hey, it's not my fault that Jerry's an idiot.\n",
        " Well, you know, I do have a Fleeseeks box.\n",
        " What? It just has a mop and some floor wax in it. Wubba lubba dub dubs!  Yeah! That's my new thing! I'm kind of like what's his name Arsenio. Isn't that it's what Arsenio used to say on his show. Wobble gobba lop bops! Right? See you next week, everybody.\n",
        " Listen to your sister, Morty. To live is to risk it all. Otherwise, you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you. Oh, I'm sorry, Jerry, I didn't see you there. H-How much of that did you hear? \n",
        " Cool. Just stay in the driveway. The killbots are live, and I took you off the whitelist.\n",
        " Absolutely, Morty. A-And your mom's lawyer says if I can get enough in the settlement, he can help me sue for full custody.\n",
        " I did not, but if you're really that alienated, I'm as willing to exploit it as the next guy, church, army, or Olympic gymnastics trainer.\n",
        " Bitch, I was ready yest--\n",
        " Morty, shoot the mohawk guy!\n",
        " High fade, chartreuse with cyan highlights, layered on top. Shoot him! \n",
        " Fuck! Get in the game, Morty!\n",
        " Holy shit, Summer for the win! \n",
        " Here we go.\n",
        " Isotope 322. \n",
        " Ugh. You have infinite sisters, Morty. I mean, n-not that I want to spend the rest of my day looking for another one. Sum-sum, let's go! Grandpa's concern for your safety is fleeting!\n",
        " Whoa. That was cool.\n",
        " Okay, getting darker.\n",
        " Aw, come on.\n",
        " Hands and little shoulder-mounted dudes where I can see them!\n",
        " Wh-Wh-What in the hell are you saying?\n",
        " All right, let's get sloppy. Oh, whoa. Uh, uh, what's, uh-What's that little bauble you got back there? \n",
        " Kids, weird pitch: let's have this be our new life. Let's be post-apocalyptic scavengers!\n",
        " Sounds good. Stay hydrated.\n",
        " Oh, get off your high horse, Professor Ski Lodge. This world may be rough around the edges, but it's got its charms.\n",
        " Uh...  bicep.\n",
        " No. Okay, I'll level with you.\n",
        " You see that green rock, Morty? It's about 20 pounds of the stuff I was getting all hard for a flake of.\n",
        " Well, having a 20-pound boulder of it is better than having a flake. I can explain the math to you later, but--\n",
        " Huh, could be therapeutic for her. She has been acting pretty crazy lately, Morty. I mean, her parents are going through a divorce.\n",
        " No, no, no. Morty, there's too much heat on the bogey. I need you to distract the camp.\n",
        " Right idea, wrong genre, Morty. The equivalent here would be...\n",
        " Save it for the Semantics Dome, E.B. White.\n",
        " The important question is, who wants to take a poke at my man Spine Eater here? \n",
        " Morty, relax. You're gonna be a ringer. Come here. \n",
        " Ugh! Hey!\n",
        " Okay, this is exciting. We're making some discoveries about muscle memory.\n",
        " Just stick and moo--oove, Morty! Wear him out!\n",
        " All right. Good job, champ. Um, can I talk to you kids for a second over yonder? \n",
        " Oh, big guy, no. Nobody's leaving. Don't be stupid. We love being united. We love the radiation, the trichinosis. We're in it for life, which I assume is around 20 years, average. I just need a quick aside with my grandkids, about 40 yards from anyone else.\n",
        " Uh, I know why don't we all split up and look for it in groups of three? Kids?\n",
        " Kiss my ass, Summer! Your friends have no mercy!\n",
        " Listen to me! Both of you kids need to get out of this environment so we can properly deal with your parents' divorce! Alternatively, I have a freaking portal gun, and I can leave the two of you here forever! \n",
        " All right, you know what? Fuck it!\n",
        " Nope, regular blood.\n",
        " Hi, sweetie.\n",
        " Oh, th-they aren't with you? I thought they were with you. Oh, y-you know what? Uh, I just remembered. They're out doing something completely ordinary and kid-related. Don't panic.\n",
        " Not a mistake, no!\n",
        " Summer, state your deal.\n",
        " Morty? \n",
        " All right.\n",
        " It's dinnertime.\n",
        " Ah ha ha ha, yeah. Dial it back, Summer. By 15% and increase dynamic movement by 3. Am I right? \n",
        " Oh, sweetie, d-don't. Listen. Don't -- \n",
        " Well, try crying 15% less?\n",
        " You do?! What the fuck is wrong with you two? The point of automation is to reduce cost and labor.\n",
        " Tell it to my bread in the morning. You just became my backup toaster.\n",
        " Sorry, sorry. I-I-I can wait for this to wrap up. Don't let me distract you.\n",
        " I want you and your sister to come home.\n",
        " You don't have to kick me while I'm down, Morty. Look, there's no replacing either of you without an amount of work that would ultimately defeat the purpose.\n",
        " I don't know if that applies to the throats of murder victims, Morty.\n",
        " Well, the longer you wait, Morty, the more it's gonna feel like committing a whole murder. I think your arm just called it too early because it wasn't the arm of a paramedic. Here.\n",
        " The reason I wanted this is because it can do this.\n",
        " You don't have to ask me twice. Home is nuts right now. My daughter's going through a divorce, and I am not dealing with it in a healthy way at all.\n",
        " Ah, Summer's home.\n",
        " Uh, we should go to the garage.\n",
        " Come on, Morty. No union built on running from your problems lasts more than five years, seven tops. Grandpa just sped things up with a few creature comforts of modern society.\n",
        " Oh, no. Sum-sum, no. But you two were perfect for each other.\n",
        " Coolsies.\n",
        " Hey, yo. Sorry for acting so weird for three weeks.\n",
        " Ah, I'm sure it was nothing. I'm gonna go, uh, work in the garage.\n",
        " What, that dice game where you shake dice and yell out, \"Downbeat\"? No, thank you.\n",
        " Man, I missed having hands and blood and a stomach.\n",
        " Absolutely.\n",
        " Yeah, either one. Either one.\n",
        " You'll never get away with this, Concerto.\n",
        " This is it, Morty.\n",
        " Jaguar! \n",
        " That, Morty, is why you don't go to therapy.\n",
        " Alright, Morty. You ready for our adventure to the lost city of Atlantis?\n",
        " Oh, for fuck\u2019s sake.\n",
        " What are you, stupid? We\u2019re done with the Citadel of Ricks. I was *burp* never on board with it in the first place, that\u2019s why I murdered everyone in charge and left it to rot.\n",
        " *glaring* Every day.\n",
        " You don\u2019t have to be a dick.\n",
        " *straps harpoon gun to his back* Well, you can keep wondering that while we go on our fun, fresh, self-contained adventure to Atlantis. *shoots a portal* Anyone continuing to explore the Citadel is either stupid, or one of the unfortunate millions held hostage by their terrible ideas.\n",
        " Anyway, that's how I escaped from space prison! Oh, scary place.\n",
        " Oh, come on. Who wants to watch a mad scientist use handmade sci-fi tools to take out highly trained alien guards when we can sit here and be a family at Shoney's? \n",
        " Emotionally speaking, honey, Shoney's is my home.\n",
        " Jerry, get out of the booth, take all your clothes off, and fold yourself 12 times.\n",
        " Six folds, huh? W-W-What, have you guys got me in a Series 9000? You cheap insect  didn't think I was worth your best equipment?\n",
        " Well, you might as well order some pancakes, because I don't see the need to leave this part of my brain.\n",
        " Shoney's.\n",
        " Relaxed enough? \n",
        "  \n",
        "  \n",
        "  \n",
        " Oh, any particular ones? You want to see my first boner, or should we go straight to the moment I discovered interdimensional travel? \n",
        "' Ooh, your little flappy doodles are twitching. Does that mean you're aroused, or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a grape?\n",
        " Yeah, well, tough titties.\n",
        " Well, that depends on who breaks first -- me or the titty.\n",
        " The day I invented the portal gun is the day I lost her.\n",
        "  Fine, but I'm driving.\n",
        " To the day it all began and ended. The moment that changed everything.\n",
        " Yeah, I'd like to get a 10-piece McNugget and a bunch of the Szechuan sauce. Like, as much as you're allowed to give me. In 1998, they had this promotion for the Disney film \"Mulan,\" where they -- where they -- they created a new sauce for the McNuggets called Szechuan sauce, and it's delicious! And then they got rid of it, and now it's gone. This is the only place we're gonna be able to try it, is in my memory.\n",
        " Okay. All right, all right.\n",
        " Me. I used to wear blue pants.\n",
        " I didn't. I did.\n",
        " Yeah. That's the three lines of math that separates my life as a man from my life as an unfeeling ghost.\n",
        " Nope, they cannot.\n",
        " Because the code you just uploaded wasn't actually my portal-gun formula, it was a virus giving me full control over the brainalyzer.\n",
        " True, but you can alter anything you want about a totally fabricated origin story.\n",
        " Mission accomplished, boys. Pull me out.\n",
        " Okay, have fun in what's left of my brain. I'm gonna transfer to yours. Oh, there's not enough room for all my genius, so I'm leaving you with my fear of wicker furniture, my desire to play the trumpet, my tentative plans to purchase a hat, and six years of improv workshops. Comedy comes in threes.\n",
        " Duh!\n",
        " Morty, take this. You're gonna need it later.\n",
        " What -- What's this supposed to accomplish? We have infinite grandkids. You're trying to use Disney bucks at a Caesar's Palace here.\n",
        " I came to kill you, bro. That's not even my original Summer.\n",
        " 20 yards, nine-gauge plasma pistol, My first shot would liquify her insides and injure you, second shot adds recoil. The risk to me is minimized if I wait for you to shoot her, which I'm encouraging you to do.\n",
        " Or let her go, which I will reward with a quicker death.\n",
        " Because it's incentive for you to give me my cleanest shot, which will be your least painful death. But if you want to die slower than that, I'm super into it. All you got to do to get that started is kill the girl.\n",
        " Not an issue, sweetie.\n",
        " Morty, I know you're too stupid to get this, but you're really  this up right now.\n",
        " I wasn't gonna let her die, you  moron!\n",
        " The point is he thought I was going to.\n",
        " You're a serious  idiot, Morty! You basically killed us all! You're the worst! You're as dumb as a bag of sand.\n",
        " Good job, Morty. Let's go, kids.\n",
        " Oldest Rick trick in the book.\n",
        " Not until I finish what I started. And that is how you get level-nine access without a password.\n",
        " Employee of the month, ladies and gentlemen.\n",
        " Destroying the  galactic government.\n",
        " Good pitches, kids. I'm almost proud. But watch closely as Grandpa topples an empire by changing a one to a zero.\n",

        " I never will, baby.\n",
        " Jerry, is there any light beer left? It's insane what you miss in prison.\n",
        " No, you're right. Where's the vodka?\n",
        " Seems like you guys need some privacy. I'll, uh -- I'll be in the garage.\n",
        " What the  Not cool, Jerry! A man's garage is his castle.\n",
        " Oh, I-I'm sorry to hear that, sweetie. I hope I had nothing to do with that.\n",
        " For everybody.\n",
        " Not so fast, Morty. You heard your mom. We've got adventures to go on, Morty -- just you and me -- and sometimes your sister and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You want to know why, Morty? Because he crossed me.\n",
        " Oh, it gets darker, Morty. Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures. First thing that's different -- no more Dad, Morty.\n",
        " He threatened to turn me in to the government, so I made him and the government go away.\n",
        " I've replaced them both as the de facto patriarch of your family and your universe. Your mom wouldn't have accepted me if I came home - \n",
        " - without you and your sister, so now you know the real reason I rescued you. Oh! I just took over the family, Morty, and if you tell your mom -\n",
        " - or sister I said any of this, I'll deny it -\n",
        " - and they'll take my side because I'm a hero, Morty. And now you're gonna have to go -\n",
        " - and do whatever I say, Morty, forever! And I'll -- I'll go out and I'll find some more of that \"Mulan\" Szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce, Morty. -\n",
        " - Because that's -- that's what this is all about, Morty.\n",
        " That's my one-armed man! I'm not driven by avenging my dead family, Morty! That was fake. I-I-I'm driven by finding that McNugget sauce.\n",
        " I want that \"Mulan\" McNugget sauce, Morty! That's my series arc, Morty.\n",
        " If it takes nine seasons, I want my McNugget dipping sauce, Szechuan sauce, Morty.\n",
        " That's what's gonna take us all the way to the end, Morty.\n",
        " Season -- Nine more seasons, Morty. Nine more seasons until I get that dipping Szechuan sauce.\n",
        " For 97 more years, Morty!\n",
        " I want that McNugget sauce, Morty!\n",
        " Don't worry about Jerry. He's gonna be fine.You hear me Jerry? You're gonna be fine!\n",
        " ooo... Watch out for that stuff. It'll stain if it gets on your clothes, and it'll send into a murderous rage if it gets in your eyes or mouth.\n",
        " I know this isn't the time, but, you know, technically the second freezer drawer is mine.\n",
        " You're overreacting!\n",
        " Alright fine, but you're not touching my CRISPR.\n",
        " What? Every hospital claims to have the best doctor in the galaxy. It's like those pizza places that claim to have the best pizza in the world. What- Do you think they have pizza contests? Have you ever been to a pizza contest?\n",
        " Fine!  Excuse me. Coming through. What are you here for- Just kidding, I don't care. Well this won't do.\n",
        " A sequel.\n",
        " Yeah me neither, we pretty much nailed it the first time. \n",
        " You gotta be careful Morty, if that guy catches you with a box of his eye-holes he comes bursting in through a window and just starts kicking the s*** outta you. But it's worth the risk, they melt in your mouth Morty! They're delicious.\n",
        " Well your thirty-nine years too late, or however old he is. Is he fifty? Oh man, Beth is, is Jerry fifity!?\n",
        " Hey, what's wrong Morty? Oh, you're worried about your dad, huh?\n",
        " Morty let's-let's see what else is on.\n",
        " Oh, man Morty. How DID she get there?\n",
        " Just stay away from the coffee machine.\n",
        " Oh man, I'm trying to remember Morty.\n",
        " Nope.\n",
        " That's Jan-Michaels.\n",
        " All right, Morty you've done it!\n",
        " Learning to fly this thing, Morty, it's gonna be really liberating. Y-Y-You\u2019re gonna be free to go on all kinds of errands for me.\n",
        " *points out the window* See that planet right there? Don\u2019t fly too close to that planet. Someone\u2019ll come out and try to wash your windshield.  Hold on. *picks up* Yup. Yeah, I have it. Where do you wanna meet? Alright, cool. *hangs up* Alright Morty, lesson\u2019s over. We got some business to attend to a few lightminutes south of here.\n",
        " *startled* WHOA! Jesus, Jerry, what the hell are you doing here?!\n",
        " I guess I remember that. *rubs forehead* Wow. And you\u2019ve just been back there this whole time? Amazing. Well we don\u2019t have time to take him to Earth, Morty. Head for 3124-917.\n",
        " Yep.\n",
        " Nope.  This is. You can park in a handicapped spot, Morty. Anything with less than eight limbs is considered disabled here.\n",
        " You kidding? I wish I had this idea. Well\u2026 I did have this idea, but I wish I was the version of me that owned it. That guy\u2019s rich.\n",
        " *checks off \u201cStowaway\u201d and \u201cAnnoying me\u201d* Trust me Morty, I\u2019ve heard stories from other Ricks. Jerrys don\u2019t tend to last five minutes off of Earth. This is a totally unregistered cross-temporal asteroid. Here they can romp and play with other Jerrys. It couldn\u2019t be safer.\n",
        " Hey Morty, hang onto this. That number\u2019s your dad. If you lose it, we\u2019re not gonna be able to get him back.\n",

        " Don\u2019t come with. It\u2019s boring, it\u2019s *burps* business stuff.\n",
        " Right, like nothing shady ever happened in a fully furnished office? You ever hear about Wall Street Morty? Y-You know what those guys do in th\u2014in their fancy board rooms? They take their balls, and they dip \u2018em in cocaine, and they wipe \u2018em all over each other. You know, Grandpa goes around, and he does his business in public because Grandpa isn\u2019t shady.\n",
        " Ah, crap. *rolls down window* Hey, what\u2019s up?\n",
        " Can\u2026 Can we please\u2026? This is my grandson, Morty.\n",
        " Ugh. *passes Krombopulos Michael a case containing the antimatter gun* Here, now go away.\n",
        " Y-Y-Y-You\u2019re gonna give him your card?!\n",
        " Ugh\u2026 You\u2019ve got what the intergalactic call a very planetary mindset, Morty. It\u2019s more complicated out here! These are Flurbos. Do you understand what two humans can accomplish with three thousand of these?\n",
        " An entire afternoon at Blips and Chiiiitz!\n",
        " Aw, this place is the best. It\u2019s got beer, games, prizes, and you can never tell what time it is.\n",
        " Yeah, sure, if you spend all day shuffling words around you can make anything sound bad, Morty. *puts a helmet on Morty\u2019s head* Here, check this out.\n",
        " Fifty-five years. Not bad, Morty. You kinda wasted your thirties though with that whole birdwatching phase.\n",
        " Morty. You were just playing a game. It\u2019s called Roy. Snap out of it, come on. *hands him his tickets*\n",
        " Lookit this. You beat cancer and then you went back to work at the carpet store? Boo.\n",
        " It\u2019s also the same as doing nothing. If Krombopulos Michael wants someone dead, there\u2019s not a lot anybody can do to stop him. That\u2019s why he does it for a living? Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, it\u2019s time to thrash your Roy score. *puts on the helmet*\n",
        " Uh-huh, yeah, that\u2019s the difference between you and me, Morty. I never go back to the carpet store.\n",
        " What are you doing Morty?! This is a Galactic Federation outpost! Look, I don\u2019t have time to tell you my entire backstory, but Grandpa and government don\u2019t get along!\n",
        " What?\n",
        " Oh, good job, Morty. Y-Y-Y-You killed my best customer but you saved a mind-reading fart!\n",
        " Morty, don\u2019t do it.  Morty\u2026  Morty, you idiot!\n",
        " We can\u2019t get him outta here. He\u2019s gaseous. He\u2019s not gonna make it through a portal, Morty.\n",
        " Morty, come on, I-I wanna go back to Blips and Chitz. I don\u2019t wanna deal with this!\n",
        " Screw this. I\u2019m out.\n",
        " Stupid-ass fart-saving carpet-store motherfucker! *shoves Morty out of the driver\u2019s seat and takes the wheel* Move!\n",
        " Wait, did you fuck with my seat settings?\n",
        " Yeah, yeah. \n",
        " That\u2019s \u2018cause my grandson drives like a male Obavradian. Yeah, I said it. Some stereotypes are based in fact.\n",
        " *interrupts him* So I\u2019ve heard. Just fix it. *to Morty* I don\u2019t think the Gromflomites can track us now, but it looks like we\u2019re gonna be here for awhile. *lowers voice* Or, ya know, if you still have that gun K. Michael dropped, we can finish the job and go home.\n",
        " I\u2019m being polite.\n",
        " Yeah, where\u2019s that? Are you going on a quest to find he who smelt it?\n",
        " Oh great, just a hop, skip, and an 800 lightyear jump!\n",
        " *walks away, muttering* Whatever you wanna do you little punk-ass little bitch\u2026\n",
        " *holding a golf club* Shut the fuck up about moonmen! This isn\u2019t a musical number. This is a fucking operation, we gotta be cool and fucking lay low!\n",
        " Son of a\u2026 *approaches Fart* Why were the Gromflomites holding you prisoner? What the fuck is so valuable about you?\n",
        " *picks up the gold* Ah, terrific. The fart that pooped gold. No wonder every cop in the system is lookin\u2019 for us! *pockets gold* Any species that gets a hold of this thing is gonna use it to take over the galaxy. Do you know how inconvenient that\u2019s gonna be to my work?\n",
        " Somebody dropped the dime on us. Gearhead\u2026 *turns around*\n",
        " Number One is me, asshole! You\u2019re supposed to be my friend!\n",
        " Two things I wanna make clear to everybody in this room. Never betray me, and it\u2019s time to go.\n",
        " Hey Morty, remember when you said selling a gun was as bad as pulling the trigger? How do you feel about all these people getting killed because of your choices?\n",
        " Tell that to Gearhead\u2019s gearsticles.\n",
        " Wrong! I\u2019d be playin\u2019 Roy right now. At a certain point, my hands are tied, Morty.\n",
        " Morty, take the wheel!\n",
        " Whoa!\n",
        " Geez, dammit, Morty! Who taught you to fly this thing?! *laughs* Haha, I\u2019m kidding, I know that\u2019s on me.\n",
        " Shit. Well, I guess this is it.\n",
        " Damn. Can\u2019t blame that on the dog. \u2026Talk about silent but deadly. I-I\u2019ve seen some nerve gas but ga- th-this gas got some nerve! Haha, you know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019?\n",
        " I\u2019ll let you know, Morty. Gone with the wind, am I right? If you don\u2019t like that one, Morty, an alt on that one could be, like\u2026if I said Gasablanca! \u2026Alright, I\u2019m done.  Let\u2019s get to the Promethean Nebula, so my grandson can finish savin\u2019 a life!\n",
        " Fine. Morty, take your fart to his hole and say your goodbyes. I\u2019m gonna find some fuel and take a biiiig fat Morty.  That\u2019s my new word for \u2018shit\u2019 because of today\u2019s events.\n",
        " So did you guys make out a little bit? Is he gonna send you a postcard?  Man, that guy hit the lottery when he crossed paths with you.\n",
        " Morty, I know I picked on your core beliefs and decision making a lot today, but I am glad you insisted on gettin\u2019 that fart home. You know, at least all the death and destruction wasn\u2019t for nothin\u2019, you know? *notices Morty\u2019s detached, almost anguished expression* You miss your fart friend, huh? Well I\u2019ve got a little surprise for you, buddy. While you were gone I found another wormhole with millions of beings just like him on the other side and they\u2019re all coming to visit.\n",
        " Too late, Morty. The hole\u2019s opening.\n",
        " Th-there\u2019s a lot more where that came from too.\n",
        " Hey. *taps another Rick\u2019s arm* Hey bro. How many people was your Roy responsible for killing today?\n",
        " *glares at Morty* Must be nice\u2026 Hey, Morty, there\u2019s our Jerry.\n",
        " Glad you\u2019re safe Jerry. What do you say we go home?\n",
        " Uh, I\u2019m not sure. Morty.\n",
        " Way to go, Morty. Eh, whatever.\n",
        " It\u2019s the coolest place in the world! Hahahaha, I g- I get to be in a commercial!\n",
        " Uh, w-why don't you get it Jerry? you're the man of the house and you don't have a job.\n",
        " It's a Courier Flap, it's like the Intergalactic version of UPS but less off-putting. *Reaches hand into courier and retrieves a metallic egg-shaped item*\n",
        "  Ughhhh... *places a napkin over the hologram and takes it to the bin in the kitchen)\n",
        " Uhhhh, l-l-let's not get carried away, Morty.\n",
        " No. Weddings are basically funerals with cake. If I wanted to watch someone throw their life away, *belch* I'd hang out with Jerry all day.\n",
        " What do you know about friendship, Jerrrrrry?\n",
        " *Still eating cereal* I assume Planet Squanch, 6000 lightyears across the galaxy.\n",
        " Yeah, I know. Now we have to go to the wedding.\n",
        " *Unscrewing and drinking from scotch flask* Hey, what's up, Squanchy?\n",
        " Beth, Squanchy culture is more... contextual than literal. You just say what's in your squanch and people understand.\n",
        " Yeah Morty\n",
        " It's my favourite song\n",
        " Oh yeah, distress beacon!  Yeah baby!\n",
        " The first rule of space travel kids, is always check out distress beacons; nine out of ten times its a ship full of dead aliens and a bunch of free shit!\n",
        " One out of ten times its a deadly trap, but I'm ready to roll those dice!\n",
        " Yeah. Cha-ching. Oh yeah, if you find a room full of eggs, don't shy away from it, give one of them a shake. Those facehuggers are worth more than this ship.\n",
        " This will make the cops write it up as a looting by the Korblocks.\n",
        " I hear you man, cops are racist.\n",
        " Oh, hey! You're alive! Thank God.\n",
        " And how do you know it didn't get on the ship with you? Those two ding-dongs seem pretty calm about the whole thing.\n",
        " Called it.\n",
        " Unity!?\n",
        " Oh boy. Uh, these are my grandkids, Summer and Morty. Summer, Morty, this is uh, Unity. We sort of used to, uh, date.\n",
        " Quite an operation you got going here Une. You're a whole planet now huh?\n",
        " Summer, rude. Why don't you kids run off and play with Unity while Unity and I do some catching up.\n",
        " World peace achieved. Nice! A little weird to publish a paper about it for yourself, but hey. So what\u2019s next?\n",
        " Oh, goody.\n",
        "  I like that. Oh, that\u2019s pretty sexy. Hey listen, where can I get a drink around here?\n",
        " Unity, Unity, who am I talking to? I watched you assimilate a whole police station just to get your hands on the evidence locker.\n",
        " Hey, listen, I\u2019ve grown too. I have! See, I\u2019ve- I\u2019ve reconnected with my family, right?\n",
        " Maybe it\u2019s part of getting old. Maybe I just miss being with\u2026 a collective.\n",
        " Oh yeah!\n",
        " Wait, wait, stop! H-Hold it! Not like this. We need a hang glider. And a crotchless Uncle Sam costume. And I want the entire field of your largest stadium covered end to end with naked redheads! And I want the stands packed with every man that remotely resembles my father!\n",
        " Oh yeah! I want youuuuuu!\n",

        " Pfft, screw those guys! Uugh, I\u2019ll be right back. Don\u2019t waste your brain on those weirdos, Unity. They\u2019re no different from any other aimless chumps that you occupy.

They take their balls, and they dip \u2018em in cocaine, and they wipe \u2018em all over each other. You know, Grandpa goes around, and he does his business in public because Grandpa isn\u2019t shady.\n",
        " Ah, crap. *rolls down window* Hey, what\u2019s up?\n",
        " Can\u2026 Can we please\u2026? This is my grandson, Morty.\n",
        " Ugh. *passes Krombopulos Michael a case containing the antimatter gun* Here, now go away.\n",
        " Y-Y-Y-You\u2019re gonna give him your card?!\n",
        " Ugh\u2026 You\u2019ve got what the intergalactic call a very planetary mindset, Morty. It\u2019s more complicated out here! These are Flurbos. Do you understand what two humans can accomplish with three thousand of these?\n",
        " An entire afternoon at Blips and Chiiiitz!\n",
        " Aw, this place is the best. It\u2019s got beer, games, prizes, and you can never tell what time it is.\n",
        " Yeah, sure, if you spend all day shuffling words around you can make anything sound bad, Morty. *puts a helmet on Morty\u2019s head* Here, check this out.\n",
        " Fifty-five years. Not bad, Morty. You kinda wasted your thirties though with that whole birdwatching phase.\n",
        " Morty. You were just playing a game. It\u2019s called Roy. Snap out of it, come on. *hands him his tickets*\n",
        " Lookit this. You beat cancer and then you went back to work at the carpet store? Boo.\n",
        " It\u2019s also the same as doing nothing. If Krombopulos Michael wants someone dead, there\u2019s not a lot anybody can do to stop him. That\u2019s why he does it for a living? Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, it\u2019s time to thrash your Roy score. *puts on the helmet*\n",
        " Uh-huh, yeah, that\u2019s the difference between you and me, Morty. I never go back to the carpet store.\n",
        " What are you doing Morty?! This is a Galactic Federation outpost! Look, I don\u2019t have time to tell you my entire backstory, but Grandpa and government don\u2019t get along!\n",
        " What?\n",
        " Oh, good job, Morty. Y-Y-Y-You killed my best customer but you saved a mind-reading fart!\n",
        " Morty, don\u2019t do it.  Morty\u2026  Morty, you idiot!\n",
        " We can\u2019t get him outta here. He\u2019s gaseous. He\u2019s not gonna make it through a portal, Morty.\n",
        " Morty, come on, I-I wanna go back to Blips and Chitz. I don\u2019t wanna deal with this!\n",
        " Screw this. I\u2019m out.\n",
        " Stupid-ass fart-saving carpet-store motherfucker! *shoves Morty out of the driver\u2019s seat and takes the wheel* Move!\n",
        " Wait, did you fuck with my seat settings?\n",
        " Yeah, yeah. \n",
        " That\u2019s \u2018cause my grandson drives like a male Obavradian. Yeah, I said it. Some stereotypes are based in fact.\n",
        " *interrupts him* So I\u2019ve heard. Just fix it. *to Morty* I don\u2019t think the Gromflomites can track us now, but it looks like we\u2019re gonna be here for awhile. *lowers voice* Or, ya know, if you still have that gun K. Michael dropped, we can finish the job and go home.\n",
        " I\u2019m being polite.\n",
        " Yeah, where\u2019s that? Are you going on a quest to find he who smelt it?\n",

        " *walks away, muttering* Whatever you wanna do you little punk-ass little bitch\u2026\n",
        " *holding a golf club* Shut the fuck up about moonmen! This isn\u2019t a musical number. This is a fucking operation, we gotta be cool and fucking lay low!\n",

        " *picks up the gold* Ah, terrific. The fart that pooped gold. No wonder every cop in the system is lookin\u2019 for us! *pockets gold* Any species that gets a hold of this thing is gonna use it to take over the galaxy. Do you know how inconvenient that\u2019s gonna be to my work?\n",

        " Two things I wanna make clear to everybody in this room. Never betray me, and it\u2019s time to go.\n",
        " Hey Morty, remember when you said selling a gun was as bad as pulling the trigger? How do you feel about all these people getting killed because of your choices?\n",
        " Tell that to Gearhead\u2019s gearsticles.\n",
        " Wrong! I\u2019d be playin\u2019 Roy right now. At a certain point, my hands are tied, Morty.\n",
        " Morty, take the wheel!\n",
        " Whoa!\n",
        " Geez, dammit, Morty! Who taught you to fly this thing?! *laughs* Haha, I\u2019m kidding, I know that\u2019s on me.\n",
        " Shit. Well, I guess this is it.\n",
        " Damn. Can\u2019t blame that on the dog. \u2026Talk about silent but deadly. I-I\u2019ve seen some nerve gas but ga- th-this gas got some nerve! Haha, you know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019?\n",
        " I\u2019ll let you know, Morty. Gone with the wind, am I right? If you don\u2019t like that one, Morty, an alt on that one could be, like\u2026if I said Gasablanca! \u2026Alright, I\u2019m done.  Let\u2019s get to the Promethean Nebula, so my grandson can finish savin\u2019 a life!\n",
        " Fine. Morty, take your fart to his hole and say your goodbyes. I\u2019m gonna find some fuel and take a biiiig fat Morty.  That\u2019s my new word for \u2018shit\u2019 because of today\u2019s events.\n",
        " So did you guys make out a little bit? Is he gonna send you a postcard?  Man, that guy hit the lottery when he crossed paths with you.\n",
        " Morty, I know I picked on your core beliefs and decision making a lot today, but I am glad you insisted on gettin\u2019 that fart home. You know, at least all the death and destruction wasn\u2019t for nothin\u2019, you know? *notices Morty\u2019s detached, almost anguished expression* You miss your fart friend, huh? Well I\u2019ve got a little surprise for you, buddy. While you were gone I found another wormhole with millions of beings just like him on the other side and they\u2019re all coming to visit.\n",
        " Too late, Morty. The hole\u2019s opening.\n",
        " Th-there\u2019s a lot more where that came from too.\n",
        " Hey. *taps another Rick\u2019s arm* Hey bro. How many people was your Roy responsible for killing today?\n",
        " *glares at Morty* Must be nice\u2026 Hey, Morty, there\u2019s our Jerry.\n",
        " Glad you\u2019re safe Jerry. What do you say we go home?\n",
        " Uh, I\u2019m not sure. Morty.\n",
        " Way to go, Morty. Eh, whatever.\n",
        " It\u2019s the coolest place in the world! Hahahaha, I g- I get to be in a commercial!\n",
        " Well, I don't like your unemployed genes in my grandchildren, Jerry. But life is made of little concessions.\n",
        " Who the fuck are you?\n",
        " Everybody just relax for a second. There's no such thing as an \"Uncle Steve.\" That is an alien parasite.\n",
        " No, you haven't Jerry. These telepathic little bastards, they embed themselves in memories they use those to multiply, spread out, and take over planets. It's disgusting.\n",
        " He's a real piece of shit! This is a big one, someone probably tracked in last week on the bottom of their shoe or on a piece of alien fruit.\n",
        " Get off the high road, Summer. We all got pink eye because you won't stop texting on the toilet.\n",
        " No, \"Steve\" put that memory in your brain so he could live in your house, eat your food, and multiply. We could be infested with these things, so we gotta keep an eye out for any zany, wacky characters that pop up.\n",
        " Thanks Mr. Poopybutthole. I always could count on you.\n",
        " Alright, there's six of us and that's it. Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, and Summer.\n",
        " Can't afford to chance it.\n",
        " Trust me, Beth, you don't wanna know how many answers that question has.\n",
        " Why couldn't I bring my portal gun?\n",
        " Six, Morty! There's supposed to be six of us! If there's seven, then that means somebody's not real.\n",
        " I guessed. That's why I aimed for his shoulder.\n",
        " Wait.\n",
        " No! Don't flashback!\n",
        " Take that!\n",
        " Everybody stop remembering! These parasites are like bed bugs, and every flashback is another mattress. Look! There's only supposed to be six people in this house.\n",
        " No! Uh, the fact that I wrote this number down means that there's four parasites.\n",
        " All right, there's six of us,  and that's it. Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, Frankenstein, Sleepy Gary, Photography raptor, Mr. Beauregard, and Summer.\n",
        " 6, 10, what's the difference? I just love the number 6 for no reason! Where's my pencil at?\n",
        " Oh, thanks, Pencilvester!  Yeah,I-I g-- I guess that is what happened, but I-I don't get why I would do that.\n",
        " That is su--  -- suspicious. We're always hearing about this Tinkles character, but we never get to \u2013\n",
        " Look, I'm not used to being this unsure for this long. I'm just gonna aim for shoulders starting with the weird girl. \n",
        "  Hold still, \"Summer.\"\n",
        " Oh, yeah? Well, what if you just think that, Sleepy Gary? I've known you for 15 years. Don't make me hurt you.\n",
        " Wait, why would you want me to -- You're one of them, aren't you?\n",
        " Shut up, Hamurai! Shut up, Amish Cyborg! What is this? '90s Conan?\n",
        " You know what, Pencilvester? It took me my whole life to realize it, but I love barbecuing.\n",
        " Watch me, baby. I'm like Tom Cruise from, um, \"Cuisine\" or w-whatever that movie's called where he makes drinks. Yeah, check me out. I'm like Tom Cruise from \"Cuisine.\"  Yeah. Is that what it's called? \"Cuisine\"?\n",
        " Wait.  Noooooo! Shoot. Now look. It's like a \"Where's Waldo?\" page. Can you find me? Check out all these zany characters. We'll be right back after these messages.\n",
        " Can't do that, Sleepy Gary. All right, everybody listen to me. I don't know if any of you guys are real, but this house has been infested with fake loved ones that spread through fake memories, and our planet will be destroyed if they get out. \n",
        " You guys, we got to hurry. I just got back from Walmart. They're selling Nintendo 3ds systems for $149.99 on sale, plus every time you buy one, you get a $50 gift card. Brings the total price down to $110 after tax. Now, listen, we can flip those sons of bitches for 230 bucks apiece easy! They're all limited-edition \"Zelda\" ones. Hurry! Hurry! Come with me! We can be rich, and we also all get to keep one and we can play Nintendo games! Nintendo, give me free stuff.\n",
        " Okay, yes, I definitely remember doing that, but also, I would never do that.\n",
        " Uh, no thank --  Okay. Trying to figure out how to lower the blast shields, huh? Anybody here think it's suspicious that a lot of people in here can't wait to get out of here?\n",
        " So, what are you gonna do when you rotate back to the world, Frankenstein?\n",
        " No! Get out of my head, parasite! No! Drop it. Give me the gun, Frankenstein!  Give it back!\n",
        "  Is anyone here even real? Am I the only real person on earth?!\n",
        " Hey, don't blame me! I tried to shoot Summer 10 minutes ago!\n",
        " Wubba lubba dub dub! Ricky ticky tavi, beyotch! And that's the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes. Hit the sack, jack. Uh-oh! Somersault jump. Aids! And that's why I always say shum shum shlippedy dop! Grassss tastes bad-ah. No jumpin' in the sewer. Burger time! Rubber baby baby bunkers! Lick, lick, lick my balls!  yeah! Say that all the time.\n",

        " Why don't you make me, implausibly naive pubescent boy with an old Jewish comedy writer's name?\n",
        " Shut up, Morty, you brainwashed, little turd that might not even be real because I'm brainwashed, too.\n",
        " Oh, oh, oh, really? Well, I remember you as a whiny, little piece of shit, Morty!\n",
        " Yeah! I've got about a thousand memories of your dumb, little ass and about six of them are pleasant. The rest is annoying garbage. So why don't you do us both a favor and pull the trigger? Do it! Do it, mother Pull the  trigger!\n",
        " What the hell?\n",
        " Holy crap, Morty, you're right.\n",
        " Well, yeah, duh-doy. T-took you long enough. \n",
        " Now let's go, Morty. We got a lot of friends and family to exterminate. \n",
        " We need to kill everyone that we can only remember fondly. Who's got a bad memory about Mrs. Refrigerator?\n",
        " Everybody back! If you're not a parasite, you have nothing to fear. What about Summer?\n",
        "  Come on, man. Haven't we ever had an uncomfortable silence or an awkward fart on a road trip? Come on, Pencilvester. Give me anything.\n",
        " You're right.  Kill Pencilvester.\n",
        " I guess I did the butler! Ha ha! Does -- d-does that scan?\n",
        " Thanks, ghost in a jar. You always were good at pointing out potentially obscure comedy.  \n",
        " From now on, let's all be careful to wash our hands when we get back from outer space. That goes for everyone.\n",
        " At least we're real, Jerry. We're real. Rikki tikki tavi!\n",
        " No, Beth! Oh \n",
        " Oh, geez! Oh, my god!\n",
        " Listen, Beth, don't torture yourself. I made a similar mistake years ago, but, you know, on a planetary scale.\n",

        " Who cares about the *belch* thing you guys are talking about? The whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a fuck. Put a shirt on your dumb dad and let's get this dumb universe rolling. Let's do this thing.\n",
        " Alright, listen, you two, we froze time for a pretty long time, so when I unfreeze it, the world's time is gonna be fine, but our time's gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize.\n",
        " It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty. I thought you learned that by now. It also means don't touch your parents or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards.\n",
        " And away we go!\n",
        " Shhh, Morty!\n",
        " Negative visualization, Jerry. It explains a lot about where you're at. Hi, sweety.\n",
        " Yeah it would literally destroy them. Now listen, why do\u2014why do\u2014why\u2014why don't you guys go get a free sunday ice cream,  go out there and get some ice creams. Here's five hundred dollars cash in unmarked moneys. I'm just gonna put it on the floor and uh, kick it on over to ya. You guys go nuts.\n",
        " Uh oh.\n",

        " Yup, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be.   One minute you're falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam!\n",
        " Actually, sorry Summer, I gotta back the M bomb on this one. I remember the conversation. We told Morty to replace all the bank's money with cookies, your job was to put the mattress under Mr. Benson.\n",
        " Whoa whoa wh-what the hell hell hell hell hell?\n",
        " *belch* Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now?\n",

        " How long exactly do we have to wear these things? They're really embarassing.\n",
        " I would have been happy to pay for it, Summer, but they don't exactly sell them at Costco. Besides, there's a larger lesson to be learned here. Get him!\n",
        " What if I told you there's a huge ticket up right behind you?\n",
        " Alright, hear me out on this. You're immortal, right, which means your life is infinite. Well in that case there's 100% chance that you'll eventually do everything, including turning around to look behind you.\n",
        " Ah, God, gross and weird!\n",
        " Summer, Morty, take off your collars!\n",
        " Good question. I suppose the answer is: I'm not certain!\n",
        " You know what I'm talking about, oh yeah. I'm gonna do the cabbage patch, Morty. Check me out I'm doing the cabbage patch dance. It's a classic dance, remember, like this. Oh shit look at that.\n",
        " Yeah.\n",
        " Shut up, Morty. The last time you felt something, we all almost died. You little s\u2014piece of shit.\n",
